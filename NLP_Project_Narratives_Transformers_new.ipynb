Much to my disappointment I waited on hold for nearly 20 minutes before they told me nobody was available and someone would call me back in 2 days. I am not sure what else to do. I\\'ve explained my situation ... I have NO income and wish to make some kind of arrangement with reasonable monthly payments, but they aren\\'t willing to work with me and keep dragging it out so that I have even more late fees that they refuse to reverse. I am feeling very abused and I\\'m already in trauma after losing my small business just 3 weeks ago and doing my best to take care of all loans, creditors and vendor relations. I could really use some assistance with this company please. I\\'ve been able to make arrangements with other entities, but they\\'re being very difficult and uncooperative iwht my efforts to find a fair resolution.\"\\nAfter over 9 months of trying to locate a way to view my bill for my Synchrony Bank issued XXXX XXXX, I have had no success. I have talked to over 7 different representatives who claimed they would fix this, which was never resolved. The company sends emails and texts saying that it will allow you to link the card to your XXXX account, however after 6 months of research I discovered that XXXX actually has NO association with this card or bank, and the card can not be added. Each time I made a complaint they resend the same text messages and emails which provided ZERO results. I have been lied to, lead on, and am having to pay a credit card bill which I have NOT ONCE seen an actual bill for. I had ordered a product many months ago which I never received, I was unable to provide a receipt for this purchase due to the fraudulent company and therefore had to forfeit the product which I paid for. This is absolutely ridiculous and after nearly a year I don\\'t know where else to turn.\\n\"I have a Capital One account, and had a balance transfer promotion on the account per a bathroom remodel. My line of credit on the card is $ XXXX, and the balance as of XX/XX/XXXX was {$8500.00}. I have since paid {$8100.00}. \\n\\nMy issue is as follows : I moved in to temporary housing in XX/XX/XXXX and requested a change of address. The address was not changed and as a result I did not receive statements until the XXXX statement was forwarded by the post office. The account has been on auto pay since the commencement of the balance transfer promotion, which included a balance transfer fee. Capital One was receiving payments all along. I since called Cap One due to the forwarding label and old address reflected on the statement and they confirmed the address had not been changed as requested, but they would proceed to make the update. \\n\\nThe address change issue led to my account being charged interest I believe for the months of XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX due to the balance transfer offer having expired. I had no other transactions other than the promo. I called the customer service department twice speaking with XXXX and XXXX ( ID XXXX ). Both acknowledged the address issues and non receipt of statements being very apologetic. Yet, they indicated Cap One does not adjust interest charged. They totally refused to escalate the call indicating they are sr. representatives and that is where it stops because they do not have the ability to transfer calls to their own supervisor or to escalate matters further. \\n\\nI called the executive office as I feel I have been treated unfairly and discriminated against and they advised me that all escalations have to go through their general customer service department. This is a large bank and it is unfathmable that this is the way they operate their business and treat customers. I am requesting that the interest charged of {$350.00} be adjusted. Credit card companies are required to provide monthly billing statements to customers, and the fact that Cap One did not do this and conveniently the Balance Transfer promo was to expire makes me believe that it was intentional. I am disputing the interest charged and am requesting an immediate refund for the amount. This will bring my account balance to XXXX. \\n\\nI hope that you can assist me with this matter. \\n\\nShould you have any questions, I can be reached at ( XXXX XXXX XXXX. My new address is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX DE XXXX. But, the new mailing address is XXXX.

I received a notice from a Collection Agency that they are handling this account. Citibank is reporting Inaccurate information, if the account has been transferred or sold to a third party for collection, it should not be reporting a balance or a past due amount. Under the FCRA guideline this is a clear Violation. I would like to have this Inaccurate information deleted from all three of my credit files. This is impacting my ability to obtain credit due to the incorrect reporting by Citibank. I have contacted Citibank concerning this issue before and it was never corrected.\\nIn XX/XX/2019 I received a phone call from XXXX XXXX stating she is going to handle my case from XXXX XXXX. She told me that and hung up. I didnt ask her anything or go into depth about anything. I received a letter today dated XX/XX/XXXX thanking me for speaking with her and that I requested for my card to be reopened. Neither are true and she lied about a letter being sent to me. XXXX wrote a letter that was basically a lie. She called to inform me she was taking the case and hung up! Nothing else was said or asked.\\n\"I have a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX store card. On XX/XX/XXXX I purchased furniture and financed it using a \"\" 12 Month Special Event \\'\\' financing. The terms of the financing agreement were that the interest would be deferred for 1 year and the full interest would be due at the expiration of the agreement on XX/XX/XXXX if the principle had not been paid in ful before the expiration. \\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I paid the full balance of my XX/XX/XXXX statement. This included the remaining \"\" Special Event \\'\\' balance in full. XXXX XXXX XXXX allocated a partial payment to the \"\" Special Event \\'\\' balance and also allocated a {$27.00} minimum payment ammount to charges made in the future ( XX/XX/XXXX ) billing cycle. The application of a payment towards the current statement ammount to the current balance and future statement, is a violation of the terms of the XXXX XXXX XXXX credit agreement. As a result {$27.00} remained on the \"\" Special Event \\'\\' balance on my XX/XX/XXXX statement along with a debit for the entire interest that would have accrued on the \"\" Special Event \\'\\' financing. I was able to contact Customer Service on XX/XX/XXXX to get a full refund of the interst. I still had to pay a {$27.00} late payment fee on the XX/XX/XXXX statement balance. Due ot my confusion I did not want to make a payment until I had resolved the huge discrepancy on the XX/XX/XXXX statement. \\nTo add insult to injury, I am a XXXX employee who was not receiving pay during the entire period that these charges were being sent to me and my attempts to resolve the issue. \\nThis is, in simple terms, a con or scheme on the part of XXXX XXXX XXXX to confuse their customers into making large interest payments that they are trying to avoid. In the 11 month run up to the final payment being due, XXXX XXXX XXXX never miss-allocated a payment. All of my payments went towards the balance of the current statement. Only on the last month did XXXX XXXX XXXX try to confuse me by miss-applying a payment to a future billing cycle. I worry that other consumers would fall prey to this con.

The CFPB states on their website : \"\" Credit card companies must establish procedures to assure that their bills are mailed or delivered to you at least 21 days before the payment is due. \\'\\' Chase now states : \"\" Your due date will be a minimum of 21 days after the close of each billing cycle \\'\\' Chase can not get their statements sent out until the billing cycle ends ; therefore, anyone receiving their statement by mail will have the time to pay their bill decreased to less than the 21 days. While I realize many people do their payments online, this change, of course, hits all the people with no computers the hardest, the people who can least afford any late fees.

XXXX XXXX stated that she reviewed my account and confirmed the utility payment on XX/XX/XXXX. She also said that my points should be in my account by the end of XXXX. She said they have to wait 10-12 weeks after the promotion ends to process the promotion batch and award out the points to their customers. She said the promotion ended on XX/XX/XXXX so by the end of XXXX the point should be in my account. \\nI waited and kept checking my account and saw by the end of XXXX I still had not received the bonus rewards points.

First she said that I had not enrolled in the promotion. I stated that I had received a confirmation page saying I was enrolled and could send it to her. \\nThen she said that I had not fulfilled the promotion because I was supposed to make recurring payments and not just one payment. We went over the terms of the promotion and I stated that I had fulfilled the two parts of the contract : I had ( 1 ) contacted my utility service provider and enrolled my BBVA Compass Visa Credit Card in the service provider 's automatic bill payment system between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ( I enrolled XX/XX/XXXX ) ; and ( 2 ) I had paid a bill to my utility service provider using my enrolled BBVA Compass Visa Credit Card by XX/XX/XXXX ( I paid a bill on XX/XX/XXXX8 ). \\nShe insisted that the promotion stated that I needed to make several payments, yet she was not able to provide evidence of this requirement. The promotion says a bill needs to be paid. The fine print does not say there needed to be two, three, or four bills paid. \\nI asked to speak to a supervisor. She said she would forward my request to a supervisor and to send her a copy of the email promotion. I sent her the email and she called me to say that after talking to the back office that I had not followed the promotion which required me to pay more than one bill. She made no mention of escalating my request to a supervisor even with my insistence. \\nI would have been more than willing to make several payments if these instructions were included in the rules of the promotion.

I did not notice the fraudulent charge on that day, and got no fraud alert from Citi Bank. On XX/XX/2019, I received a large box of energy bars from XXXX. I called XXXX to determine why they had sent me these bars. They stated that an order had been placed in my name, and using my credit card. I immediately called my credit card company and told them of this fraudulent card. They said they would open a fraud investigation and reverse the charge. They then closed my credit card and sent a new card. \\n\\nI called back XXXX and asked them if they wanted me to ship there bars back, thinking that they were also somehow a victim in this fraudulent charge, and they should get their bars back since the credit card company was reversing the charge. \\n\\nThey emailed a shipping label, and I returned the energy bars to them. \\n\\nInXX/XX/XXXX, without any notification or attempt to contact me or determine if I really did receive the shipment or if I'd returned it, Citi Bank revered the {$570.00} credit to my card. Upon calling Citi after seeing this charge on my card, their rep stated that their fraud department had determined that I had received a shipment, and was therefore responsible for the charge. They demanded that I show proof that I returned the bars, and that they would investigate my claim to determine whether they would reverse the charge again. I stated that I did not place the order, and that had never contacted me about whether I had the product. They were very clear that the only determination as to whether I should be charged was whether I had received a shipment. After speaking with a rude customer service agent who could only tell me there was nothing she or I could do other than provide proof that the energy bars were shipped back, I asked to speak with a supervisor. The supervisor I spoke with was condescending, using a mocking tone of voice and seemed to take pleasure telling me that I had to provide proof or there was no recourse. \\n\\nThis complaint is against both Citi Bank and XXXX. Citi Bank enables fraudulent companies to charge unwitting consumers large amounts by forcing the burden of proof on the victim. I have absolutely no recourse to recover this large amount of money without proof that I no longer have something that I did not want. Regardless of whether I had kept these bars, shipped them back, or threw them away, there was never any communication by Citi on their requirements as to what I needed to do so that I would not be charged. \\n\\nXXXX disputed the reversal and provided proof to Citi that they shipped these bars, even though I had sent them back. I believe this clearly shows that they are actively defrauding consumers by shipping these outrageously overpriced bars to stolen credit cards so that they can charge everyone who is not savvy enough to ship the bars back and keep the shipping information.\",\n",

Also, I suggested the agent that I should have received the credit of past purchase in my account and my account should show a credit from now onwards. \\n\\nLater when I was not getting the statement, I called up XXXX  card to verify why I can\\'t login or check my account ONLINE. While checking they confirmed the address provided was wrong and they updated my account detail and enabled my online login. \\n\\nWhile checking the online statement, I saw again that my account is not current and I requested them to send my the statement of last 6 months because in the month of XXXX, I moved to a new apartment. They never send me the statement. \\n\\nCome XX/XX/XXXX, I logged in to my account and I saw that my account once again keep on increasing and there was a large amount outstanding in form of Late Fee plus interest rate. I once again call the customer care and inquired about the reason behind this. PLEASE note that all these calls went on for around 2 hours wherein me as a customer has to be in a ping pong stage all this time and none of the agent makes any note to the account. So, everytime I call I have to explain everything from scratch and all calls goes 2+ hours.

Agent suggested that they will reissue the credit and to stop this late fee plus interest charge, please make the remaining payment. I made the payment again just to make my account current and also made the request to the agent that PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS NOT GETTING REPORTED TO CREDIT BUREAU as this is XXXX system problem and me as a customer should not be getting impacted.

But again it was getting delayed and the only option agent can tell me is the best option is please pay the amount by cash and whtever is outstanding XXXX  customer support will take care and will revert back. Despite the fact the agent agrees that there is an outstanding credit which I should receive ( can\\'t imagine why it takes 1 to 2  month!! ) and all the charges was ongoing late fee plus interest rate, he was suggesting that system has no way to stop all these charges even though it was not at all my mistake. I also asked the agent whether they make any note in the account when a customer calls so that he/she don\\'t have to repeat again and again from scratch, he said yes we keep note of it. Later as there was no way he can confirm that the issue will be resolved, I dropped the call. Once again on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, I called back the customer care just to check whether any note was mentioned by the earlier agent with whom I was on the call from store for around 2 plus hour, to my utter disbelief there was no note and this time too the agent was telling me \"\" you have an outstanding balance and do you want to pay it \\'\\'. \\n\\nDuring the call on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX time XXXX hours, when I requested that I need to talk to the manager, the agent told me that manager will call after 48 hours. when I stress on the fact that can you make sure that the case note is made, he said yes and slowly disconnected my call.

              " \"On XX/XX/2019 I called Bank of America to inquire about balance transfer offers because my online account page said I needed to contact them to provide more information on my account. After providing the information requested, they responded by lowering the credit limits on the two cards I have with BofA by over $4,000, or basically all of my available credit. The reasoning was that the amount owed on one or more of my cards was too high. One card was at about 50% of the limit, while the other was near 70% of the limit. When I asked what an appropriate debt to limit percentage was, to avoid this issue in the future, they said they were not able to share that with me, and that there was nothing they could do about the credit limit decrease. My feeling is that the real issue is that I have used low or 0% balance transfer offers to keep my interest rates low on my accounts. BofA has increased my credit limit and even offered me a new card in the last few years, and continued to extend 0% balance transfer offers up until XX/XX/2019. It seems they view me as a credit risk because I keep a low interest rate. By lowering my credit limit they have now increased my debt to credit limit ratio, which will negatively effect my credit score until it is paid off. My interest rate on the debt I carry with them will now rise from nearly 0% to over 25%. This is absolutely predatory lending. If they didn't want me to use the 0% balance transfer offers, don't extend them to me, but lowering my credit limits seems counterintuitive to the reason they gave me for why they were lowering them in the first place.\",\n",

I immediately sent a request to cancel this trip to this \"\" agent \\'\\' and demand a full refund since this was over 90 days before the \"\" trip \\'\\' ( 180 days in fact ).

I paid {$110.00}. When we arrived we showed up to the front desk and purchased wristbands. We were talking to their associate at the front desk for about 15 minutes after we already made a purchase because we were confused as to how it works. The associate didnt thoroughly explain so we just said wed figure it out. We walked around the entire place for about a Half hour trying to figure out what rides our younger children could get on. Not to mention the wait time that we had to wait to get on. They could only get on 2 rides by their self. While we were in line our son came to us and asked what else could he do? He played all of the arcade games already. We were confused because it had only been about 20 minutes. He said that a lot of the games were broken and a lot of the arcade games were exactly the same. We then went up to the front and We asked the supervisor if we could have our money back because our children could not get on any rides and we were unhappy about our son not getting any use out of his arcade pass. The supervisor straight up said no because we have been there for over an hour but in reality we were trying to figure out what our children could get on. He also mentioned that the arcade pass was very useful because there were over 60 arcade games when that wasnt true. I pointed out that a lot of his arcade games were broken and I also pointed out that there might be 60 arcade games but theyre all repetitive so in reality there is not 60 arcade games and the manager didnt say anything about that he just said we cant give you your money back. I was very distraught and my children were very sad because they couldnt get on anything. The signs were not clear. If they were we wouldnt have stood in line talking to the cashier 15 minutes after we already purchased the tickets be supervisor was very unhelpful throughout the whole ordeal and he wasnt willing to help us in anyway possible. I tried to dispute the charge with my bank and my bank Basically told me that I authorized the purchase when that wasnt even what the dispute was about. My bank accidentally put down my dispute was not as described. My dispute was about unsatisfied by services that werent rendered. they basically took the business side over mine. The dispute was about the services that we did not receive and the unsatisfaction of the experience\\n\"I filed the following CFPB complaint re : Capital One Case : XXXX CFPB No : XXXX in late XX/XX/XXXX.

As well as charges from XXXX for {$1.00}, billed to your account on XX/XX/XXXX, {$39.00} billed to your account on XX/XX/XXXX, {$39.00} billed to your account on XX/XX/XXXX, and {$39.00} billed to your account on XX/XX/XXXX.

Bonus ThankYou Points are not available if you received a new cardmember bonus for Citi Rewards+, Citi ThankYou Preferred, Citi ThankYou Premier/Citi Premier or Citi Prestige, or if you have closed any of these accounts, in the past 24 months. \\'\\' I have met all the terms of this offer.

The system is incorrectly flagging my citi rewards+ credit card as having received a new card member bonus when it has not. The citi rewards+ credit card was product changed from a citi XXXX XXXXs gold credit card on or around XX/XX/XXXX. I have attached an email from citi welcoming me to the credit card on XX/XX/XXXX ( the card was opened before I received this email ). XXXX agreed that this was incorrect as the bonus I had earned was XXXX XXXX XXXX miles and not a citi thank you points cardmember bonus which is in accordance to the above terms. \\n\\nI have not closed any Citi ThankYou Card or received a new card member bonus for the \"\" Citi Rewards+, Citi ThankYou Preferred, Citi ThankYou Premier/Citi Premier or Citi Prestige \\'\\' in over 24 months. The last ThankYou card member bonus I earned was for the Citi Prestige in XXXX of XXXX. I have attached a points earning summary for the past 29 months. You can see there has been no new cardmember bonus earned. You can also see the only points I have earned from the citi Rewards+ credit card was XXXX thankyou points from the 10 % rebate that is a benefit of the card. \\n\\nI have tried calling Citi to rectify this, but have been unsuccessful. Confirming with both representatives over the phone, I am 100 % eligible for the new cardmember bonus as I, again, have not closed any citi thankyou card or earned a new card member bonus for the \"\" Citi Rewards+, Citi ThankYou Preferred, Citi ThankYou Premier/Citi Premier or Citi Prestige \\'\\' in over 24 months. \\n\\nCiti, please reward the bonus as I have met every term listed.\"\\nWhen applying for any credit product with Comenity Bank, I keep getting the same letter claiming my credit report has a freeze. One letter today in the mail states that I have too many inquires within the bank itself and they used XXXX, but XXXX is LOCKED and that is false information. I have enclosed all the supporting documentation.Also when calling any of the numbers on the letters from my number I get a recording that I am not authorized to contact that number.So how can I contact my creditor if they have the number blocked? A copy of that recording is enclosed too.I contacted the bank on a different line today and the representative said that my credit file has a freeze, which it does not. She said to wait XXXX days after contacting the credit reporting agency and re-apply. This same thing has been going on for over 7 months, same letters, same calls, same answer.\\n\"I have a Citi Shop Your Way Sears Mastercard. It is a general purpose credit card specifically tailored to Sears. \\n\\nI cancelled a Sears protection plan back in XXXX and I was supposed to receive a refund of {$1200.00} plus tax. I followed up today, XX/XX/2019, after I had still not received the refund check promised only to find out that the refund had been issued to my Shop Your Way card on XX/XX/2019 without my knowledge and with no notice. What is more, during this time ( or recently ) my card apparently was issued a new card number, but no one notified me or even sent me a new card. So I had to sort through that confusion as well. I still do not have a card with the new card number. \\n\\nMy card had a {$0.00} balance so my money has just been sitting there with a negative balance this entire time ( earning interest no doubt ). It is, I believe, standard practice to eventually cut a check when there is a negative balance on a card for a prolonged period of time ( especially a large balance such as this one ). However, it is clear that there was no plan on the part of Citi/Sears to do this. ( Incidentally, my refund was reduced by {$89.00} plus tax for a home visit to service my refrigerator ; however, this was incorrectly charged, as the visit was covered under the regular 1 year manufacturer \\'s warranty - Now waiting on Sears to refund this as well, which I presume will also go to my credit card ). \\n\\nI have called the card \\'s customer service phone number three times today at different times. I have held for very long periods of time, and still no answer. \\n\\nThe final straw is the message I received in the \"\" secure message center \\'\\' following my message sent earlier today, in which I requested to receive my funds immediately. The message reads as follows : We received your recent inquiry regarding your account. We are unable to issue a refund at this time. A credit has been issues for an item in dispute. If the dispute is resolved in your favor, then a refund will be processed at that time. Please let us know if we can be of further assistance. \\n\\nObviously, this reply is completely unresponsive to the matter at hand. Since no one answers the phone, I have decided to allow the CFPB the opportunity to issue a directive to one of the major banking institutions in our country, requiring it to be responsive to clients. It needs to have customer service agents who will answer the phones, and it must send clients the money they are entitled to. \\n\\nAwaiting your action and reply. \\n\\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX\"\\nI purchased a refrigerator for {$1400.00} using Wells Fargo Credit card, the refrigerator makes loud roaring sounds, I called the merchant but the merchant was of no use and did not solve the problem, so I filed the dispute with Wells Fargo and they gave 30 days to the merchant to respond, merchant did not respond in 30 days and Wells fargo made the credit permanent. Now after two months merchant contacted Wells Fargo and said that now they want to respond and Wells fargo opened the dispute again.

I came to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and the cab driver took me to a restaurant in XXXX, where I was forced to give my credit card even though there was absolutely no service provided. \\nThe name of the restaurant was in XXXX and hence I could not read. There were 2 charges that was made at the place on the same day on my credit card were {$1400.00} & {$2400.00}. \\n\\nCitibank responded to my dispute by sending a sales receipt from the merchant. \\n\\nI responded to them saying the sales receipt is totally fake and also my sign was forged. The charges show some amount like {$250.00} for mixed fruit and {$900.00} as some drink. I am pretty sure they do not even have a menu with the amounts. \\n\\nAlso the receipt shows {$1100.00}, while I was charged {$1400.00} and {$2400.00} on the same day. I sent a reply to Citi asking the merchant to provide explanation for the same? \\n\\nThis is totally an extortion where in these people are fleecing foreign customers. I had called the Citibank customer service on the same day to inform regarding the fraud committed and to dispute the charges. \\n\\nThe cab driver who took me to the place was XXXX and his number is : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The XXXX authorities are trying to nab this person but looks like he has absconded from XXXX. A formal case has been registered with the XXXX authorities. \\n\\nI have asked Citibank that the charges immediately withdrawn from my card. The investigation is taking too long and I am not confident if the same will be resolved. I have called the customer service multiple times but not much information is received other than the case is being investigated.',\n",

I pay off the statement monthly and do not carry a balance. This included the fraudulent charges totaling {$75.00}. I asked about the charges and was advised I\\'d have to pay or I would accrue interest. I made the complete payment under direst. The new card was received and activated a week later. When activating, I asked about the Fraud Case and was given the same information ; resolution takes between 30-60 days. Calls were placed to Chevron again on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX as this would be 30 and 60 days after the original claim. No resolution case being researched. On XX/XX/XXXX a call was placed to Chevron once again to follow up. Was advised by a Supervisor that the previous claim, \"\" was not completed \\'\\' correctly in their system.

It took almost 12 hours to receive a text from Chevron Fraud. When we spoke with them we advised that we were indeed traveling and we attempted to use the card, asked about the Fraud Case from XX/XX/XXXX. Once again we were told that there was an error. They could not explain why the case has not yet been reviewed or researched. I asked for a Supervisor or Manager to escalate as we are now at 134 days without any research being performed. The representative ( XXXX ) stated there was no one above her and \"\" she knew how to do her job \\'\\'. Feeling that after multiple call and no resolution I was not satisfied and had no faith in their process. Concerned about our account and credit I asked to cancel the card. She proceeded to cancel the card and said there was nothing anyone could do for me and hung up. I immediately called back again to place a complaint on the representative ( XXXX ) as well as the entire process. I asked for the case to be escalated as I understood from the FTC that the creditor must resolve the dispute within two billing cycles ( but not more than 90 days ).

I subsequently received a letter through regular mail from them, asking me to contact them to answer whether or not I attempted to resolve the dispute with the merchant prior to filing the dispute with NFCU. I called NFCU the same day, and I confirmed to the representative I spoke with that I did indeed attempt to resolve the dispute with the merchant prior to filing the claim. She then told me to disregard the mailed letter and to expect a follow-up letter containing the results of my dispute. \\nAfter receiving no such letter, I called NFCU and asked for the dispute results. The representative told me that my billing correction request was denied without offering an explanation. I then asked to speak with a supervisor. After a lengthy hold, I spoke with the supervisor. She denied that NFCU had received the dispute-documents. After explaining to her that I had received written communication that the documents I submitted were properly received, she asked me to send them again. I sent them again by secure messaging through NFCU \\'s website. She then said that she did not receive them. I sent the documents again, and again she denied receiving them.

She assumed that I was saying I was unhappy with the results of the Mediation, and that is why I want my money back. I said no such thing, nor did I intimate anything like that. I want my money back because the attorney violated the retainer agreement : ( 1 ) She refused to continue work on the Mediation without extra payments from me despite our written and verbal agreement of a {$2000.00} fixed fee for the Mediation. ( 2 ) She refused to file the petition that was offered and accepted during the Mediation unless paid more money.\\n\\n( 3 ) She ceased work immediately without providing the 10-day notice required by the terms of the retainer agreement/contract. \\n\\nI explained this to the NFCU supervisor but I don\\'t think she understood the situation.

In XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from Home Depot stating that I owed {$160.00} to be paid immediately or it would be sent to a collection agency. I quickly contacted Home Depot and they told me that I now owe over {$200.00}. I explained to them how I never received any emails and he looked up my account and told me that they had my wrong email address, he said it was my fault, he was very rude to me and told me that I could pay {$160.00} today, but if I do not pay right at that moment then the amount would go back up to over {$200.00}. I became upset due to being treated so rude by the employee that I ended the call with this employee. I called again the next day and spoke to someone else who told me they would take {$160.00} and we could be done with this. Again the employee saw that they had the wrong email address, she apologized, but stated she could not do anything about this. I paid the late fee with the understanding that this would help my credit, but then found out on my own research that Home Depot reported 3 late fees and a closed account on my credit report. I again called Home Depot and asked them to please take this off my credit report as I had not received any emails in regards to this bill and how I paid more than the amount I should have due to fees that were accrued. The person told me that she can not take anything off the credit report once it is reported, but that since I was such a good customer they would re-open an account for me. I declined this and contacted XXXX which made Home Depot tell me that they \"\" did an investigation and concluded that it was the fault of the consumer, not the banks \\'\\', because I am \"\" responsible for ensuring contact information is correct and updated \\'\\'.

They refused to indicate in my account at my request that I was going to engage regulators into this investigation.

I continued to explain to them that I did not make these charges and they refused to credit me my money back even though they can not prove I made the charges.

              " 'I am disputing the annual fee refund of {$87.00} dated XX/XX/XXXX against an annual fee of {$95.00} assessed on XX/XX/XXXX for my Amex Blue Cash Preferred credit card account. \\n\\nOn my billing statement with closing date XX/XX/XXXX, I was assessed an annual fee of {$95.00}, with the charge posting on the same date. At the time that the fee was assessed, I had not made any new charges on the account since XX/XX/XXXX, so I considered whether I wanted to keep the card account and pay the annual fee or close the card for an annual fee refund. \\n\\nIn my decision-making process, I relied on the following language in my cardholder agreement : You may close your Account by calling us or writing to us. \\nIf an Annual Membership fee applies, we will refund this fee if you notify us that you are voluntarily closing your Account within 30 days of the Closing Date of the billing statement on which that fee appears. For cancellations after this 30 day period, the Annual Membership fee is non-refundable. If an Annual Membership fee applies to your Account, it is shown on page 1 and page 2 of Part 1 of the Cardmember Agreement. \\n\\nUltimately, I decided to close my credit card account. On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted customer service via the telephone number listed on the back of my Amex Blue Cash Preferred credit card with the intention of cancelling the account. This contact was within the 30-day period allowed in the cardmember agreement for closing the card for a full annual fee refund. \\n\\nWhen I reached a customer service representative and communicated my intention to close my account because I did not want to pay the annual fee, the representative offered to downgrade my Blue Cash Preferred account to the Blue Cash Everyday product. \\n\\nIn my communications with the representative, I understood the offer to mean that upon the completion of the downgrade process, I would be able to keep the credit card account open and have my annual fee refunded. I had not made use of the card since XX/XX/XXXX and this appeared to be a logical and reasonable retention offer from Amex. \\n\\nI accepted the offer given by the representative. My online account reflected the change in card product, and I later received updated cards and documents reflecting the change. However, sometime later, I checked the card account activity online and noticed that the \"\" ADJUST MEMBERSHIP FEE \\'\\' transaction was a credit only in the amount of {$87.00}, rather than the full {$95.00} I was expecting. \\n\\nOn the afternoon of XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted customer service again via telephone to inquire about the discrepancy. The representative I spoke to mentioned something about the amount being a result of annual fee proration, but offered to submit a dispute inquiry for the discrepancy in what I was expecting. I was placed on a hold for several minutes, but the representative never returned back to the line and it appeared that the call was ultimately dropped. \\n\\nLater in the day, I contacted customer service again to inquire again about my issue, as I did not believe I had concluded my business in the previous call. This time, the representative I spoke to said something to the effect that my reduced refund was a result of my card having been open at the time the fee was assessed, and that my request to adjust the amount of the annual fee would not be considered. \\n\\nAssuming that what the representative stated was accurate, I am troubled for several reasons. The first is that, assuming that I have characterized the policy correctly, the proration of annual fees even for downgrade requests within 30 days after the assessment of the annual fee was not clearly communicated to me. I do not recall the representative with whom I requested account closure say that the annual fee assessed would not be refunded to me in full. If I had been aware of this fact, I would have chosen to close the card account instead. \\n\\nThe second reason is that the annual fee refund posted past the 30-day period mentioned in the cardholder agreement in which I would be entitled to a full annual fee refund if I closed the account. If this had happened earlier within the cancellation window, I could have had the opportunity to change my mind and decide to close the account instead. At this point in time, I am outside the stated period, so a request to close the account now would not have any effect on the annual fee refund. \\n\\nIn addition, this proration policy was unexpected to me, having dealt with annual fee refunds from account downgrades and closures with other issuers before ( e.g., XXXX and XXXX XXXX ). In those situations, I have received full annual fee refunds whenever they were requested within the stated annual fee refund period. Amex \\'s policy does not seem to be in line with the practices of other credit card issuers. \\n\\nI will also observe that, as I had not used my card for purchases since XX/XX/XXXX, I could hardly be claimed to be taking advantage of Amex \\'s annual fee refund policy by making use of card benefits just before requesting an annual fee refund by account closure. If I had requested full account closure in my original contact with customer service, I don\\'t believe I would be in this situation now. \\n\\nTo date, I have had mostly positive interactions with Amex, and I have other card accounts with Amex. I feel that on this issue, however, I have been misled by Amex customer service, preventing me from attaining the full annual fee refund by account closure that I originally intended. My customer service experience makes me reconsider whether I should continue to keep my card accounts open and use them for purchases in the future.',\n",

However, it has not done the same for me and I must be appeased. \\n\\nAlthough I have been challenging this credit card charge posted to my account since XX/XX/XXXX, BoA, as merchants XXXX bank, has not fulfilled its obligation to refund the amount of the charge to me. According to the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ),  if there is a credit card processor involved in this transaction, which I believe it is in this case, then the obligation to refund the {$9000.00} charge is contractually assumed by BoAs credit card processor. Although I have no idea who that credit card processor might be, the payment by the issuing bank should be credited to my credit card account effective immediately. BoA as XXXX merchant bank must seek reimbursement from its merchant XXXX, not me. I believe one of the reasons BoA is reluctant to provide me with the chargeback is that it might have failed to establish a reserve account to protect itself from high risk industries, such as those in which XXXX operated and consequently help the FTC to shut it down for having been a fraudulent/scamming company.

I had sent them over 80 pages of bank statements showing that PayPal was taking money out of my account on a account that was fraudulently opened. On XX/XX/XXXX they stated give them 2 billing cycles. I called back on XX/XX/XXXX to check on the status if my refund they stated I need to resend bank statements. Did that on XX/XX/XXXX they confirmed they received it and to allow 30-45 days so I called on XX/XX/XXXX they stated they could not use the bank statements I sent in so on XX/XX/XXXX I called and they confirmed they received my documentation and allow 30-45 days. I\\'ve called every month and get transferred to several people I even spoke with the fraud department and they stated they were sending a email on XX/XX/XXXX to allow 3-5 days called back on XX/XX/XXXX they stated my account need closed from the fraud department and to call back in 3-5 days I called back on XXXX stated nothing has changed and to call back so on XX/XX/XXXX I called spoke to 2 different departments 1 lady stated she dont see no change and suggested i call recovery department spoke to that department the guy seen my 82 pages of bank statements and stated he\\'s sending the information over to request a refund and to allow another 30-45 days to call back.Here we are today and still no payment refund. I\\'ve been dealing with this situation for 8 months for them to process my payment refund request. They have been giving me a run around, wasting my time and energy, This is very stressful considering they state that the payment refund department doesn\\'t have a phone number to call they can only send emails. It didn\\'t take them 8 months to take money from my account but its taking 8 months for them to return my money especially they have the bank statements to showing they were receiving payments.\\n\"Dear CFPB, In XX/XX/2018 I contacted Citigroup regarding a problem on my account ( see attached letter Letter to Citigroup XXXX sensitive information in the email XXXX ) describing in details that a service that they provide to other customers of suppressing sensitive account information, such as account balance, amount of available credit, and amount of minimum payment due, in unsecured emails was not provided to me. \\n\\nFollowing my initial request in XX/XX/2018 I contacted Citigroup several times when I was receiving unsecured email messages that contained sensitive account information and exposed my account balance and other financial information to unauthorized third parties that handled the delivery of the unencrypted email message via the Internet. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/2018 Citigroups executive response unit representative XXXX XXXX sent me a letter a copy of which is attached as response from Citigroup XXXX unsecured emails XXXX ) in which they claimed that my concerned was addressed, that the email messages being sent to me contain only the last four digits of my account number and do not contain any other sensitive information. XXXX XXXX response also contained a sentence informing me that Citigroup considers the matter resolved and will no longer respond to my inquiries regarding the fact that the email notifications I receive from Citigroup contain my account balance, minimum payment and available credit information. \\n\\nI have to emphasize that Citigoup provides the service that I requested of suppressing sensitive information in unsecured email messages to other customers, however they would not attempt to troubleshoot the issue related to my account and therefore my account is adversely affected. \\n\\nFor Citigroups reference I am enclosing the last 12 statement notification emails that were sent to me via unsecured email messages. All of the messages contain sensitive information and most of them were sent to me after XX/XX/2018, the date that XXXX XXXX claimed that the matter related to this issue is resolved and Citigroup refused to consider any further communication from me regarding this matter.\"\\nBarclays Bank offers the XXXX XXXX credit card.

For safety I used a Virtual Credit Card number provided by their web services while logged into my account.

This is unacceptable - the account is less secure as I can not see the charges, I can not make payments on any of my active three credit cards. \\n\\nThis brings into question their disaster recovery story - how can it take a business more than two weeks to recover any aspect of an online service? \\n\\nDue to my many XXXX begging them to do their jobs and restore my access they have reminded me that I can pick up the phone and make payments to them over the phone. This defeats the use and history of me managing my account for years via the web site. It also would make me have to surrender my checking account number to them over the phone - more great security issues for Citi.\"\\nThe incident occurred on XX/XX/XXXX when I accidentally left my phone and and serve prepaid card at the store.

I was out of town and then they caught one of them and returned item to shipper and it was received on the XX/XX/XXXX and I have yet to receive the refund for that item in the amount of XXXX. And my XXXX account is on hold because they withdrew payment for all of those items but at the same time there was also two charges made at XXXX XXXX to my card while I was out of town.

They returned a small amount of the XXXX but with interest I can not pay and they closed all accounts to tell me there is no further research they can do to refund the money or reopen the credit card that they rightfully closed.

              " 'This is a complaint against American Express and XXXX XXXX Credit Card Services for credit card transactions I had incurred from XX/XX/XXXX through to XX/XX/XXXX, for the purchases of gift cards that were intended to fix my computer security issues. \\n\\nI am disputing all the charges for the second time, in light of proof that I have traced that the gift cards were used to purchase merchandise, rather than as instruments to fix my computer security issues, which is the very reason I purchased them. \\n\\nI purposefully used the credit card companies to protect me as a consumer and card member for services that require third parties, particularly for Consumer Protection Guarantee, so that I receive the services I pay for using their card services. This time, the companies are telling me that I am responsible for purchasing the merchandise and for having them mailed to an address or addresses which are not my own home address. Details of the shipping address or addresses of the merchandise are available with the police department of my city, as the stores are legally not allowed to release that data to me. \\n\\nI have had computer security issues for some months now, and this started when my identity was stolen in XXXX and the IRS spotted the fraudulent use of my social security number. \\n\\nI had received phishing emails in the last months of XXXX, two of my cards were used in places I did not go to, for purchases made through a third party I do not use. \\n\\nIn XXXX, I had issues with my computer screen where I had saved the XXXX telephone number that I used to call and be called from to deliver and pick up my computer after repairs. This telephone number is the very same number you would call if you have an XXXX subscription. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, after sending off to XXXX  Contact Support one of the phishing emails with fake purchases phishing for my XXXX XXXX, I get a call from that same XXXX   number, XXXX, which of course I picked up, thinking they were XXXX  calling to fix my computer security issues. \\n\\nAs it had turned out, a group posing as XXXX XXXX XXXX had masked the XXXX telephone number. The actors first give me a fake XXXX  Case number and then proceed to ask me to type commands on the XXXX app or the XXXX XXXX app on my XXXX to show me I had 139 hacking connections. I later learned from the XXXX XXXX XXXX   that is a tactic they use to make it appear that I have hacking connections, but they were merely wi-fi connections I had previously used. I am not an XXXX XXXX  technician and I know a million other XXXX users who would not know the difference. The actors then ask me what other signs I had been getting that I had security issues. I name all the issues I have been having. They then tell me I need security keys to de-hack my computer. This is where the gift cards come in. At a time of fear of losing work and family data accumulated over the years, I did what I was asked to do, which is buy the gift cards by the $ XXXX and sit in my car and give them the gift card numbers and their access codes. At the end of the first day, after spending at least a {$1000.00} on gift cards, I ask them how XXXX will pay me back. They then send me an email of refund for the same amount spent each day on gift cards. This occurred for four days in total. I would repeatedly ask each day how XXXX will refund me all that money. The actor would say, XXXX will not risk their reputation not paying you back for such a small amount. A fake checks picture is also produced on the third day for the total spent for three days. To increase the risk of having more hacking connections, I am told on the third day that my hacking connections were interfering with the XXXX servers, and this was when I get into an argument with them saying that if they really needed to fix my security issues, they should send a technician over or get me a XXXX  XXXX   appointment as quickly as possible. To this they replied they would have to turn off all my XXXX devices for seven days and that it would take them seven days to fix my computer. I said I could not do that because I had to travel out of state in the weekend. This gave them more reason to send me out to buy more cards and expedite the process. The other grueling part of this ordeal was when purchasing the gift cards, the stores would only have a policy of selling gift cards at {$1000.00} maximum per transaction. I had to dodge this in many ways that was humiliating and do and say things I would not normally do in groceries and stores. The scammers said that if I told the credit card companies that my computer was being hacked, they would block me off forever. This raised a red flag, but then I also had my computer security in mind, so that I was under duress the whole time. Finally on day four, when I had exhausted my credit, the actor posing as an XXXX   technician asked that I use my debit card, to which I said, There is money in there, but that is for my food. If I use that, I will not have any food money. He said, Theres no money in there? That was when I realized they were crooks after my cash. In the meantime, on the third day, they tell me that there were a few strong connections and suggested that my computer is being used by XXXX  users so that it will take more security keys to de-hack my computer. Catching up with work and exhausted by the third day, I almost gave in to losing my data to the alleged hackers. By the fourth day, the day before I was to travel, when they did not call at XXXX XXXX  as they did three days before, I decided to call them to finally fix my security issues. That was when I got the real XXXX people and learned I had been scammed. \\n\\nMy dispute to the credit card companies is where are the goods and services I paid for using the gift cards? I obviously did not get my computer fixed. I traced the merchandise trail the gift cards were used through XXXX XXXX XXXX  and XXXX, both being the main stores where most of the merchandise were bought. I was informed by both companies the merchandise were shipped to an address or addresses but not to mine, which now makes this a theft by deception crime, as I was informed by an XXXX detective. In the past, XXXX XXXX issued me refunds for fraudulent purchases made in another state when I was not present, for goods or services I did not use or receive. I am grateful those were dealt with promptly. What is the difference between my credit card being fraudulently used without me being present, versus paying for gift cards which were used to buy merchandise and shipped to recipients other than myself? Scam or no scam, I received nothing, as what had happened when I was not present when my debit card was fraudulently used. I did not get any services nor merchandise for any of the transactions, but a few companies did get the monies I am now supposed to be responsible to pay both American Express and XXXX XXXX Credit Card services.\"\\nAmerican Express are discrimination against me due to my XXXX under the American with disabilities act title III regarding my request under the Fair Credit Billing Act and the Federal Arbitration Act regarding the terms and conditions of the Credit Card agreement.\\n\"This complaint including GM Card/Capital One credit Card companies, and XXXX XXXX XXXX   XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. \\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX address : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, IL XXXX, phone : XXXX 1.

I waited for this to be corrected. I was assured by the management team on the phone that they were working to achieve this. So I waited. As interest accrued on my account, I was concerned ; which I communicated on every call. Now, because I was told this was going to be corrected, {$3800.00} worth of fees, and interest were assigned to my account I asked that the calls be pulled, and listened to, in an effort to have the facts confirmed, as this was a conversation in each call.

I did receive a email letting me know the process could take up to 7-10 business days.

After waiting 4-5 days, I still have not heard anything. After a week, I called back and the same recording that my application is still under review. I received an email letting me know that I needed to mail or fax over my ID and social security card in which I faxed over my Driver \\'s License, Social Security Card and a copy of my new lease agreement.

The same delivery vendor ( XXXX  ) delivered the second item in the order but failed to deliver the main and more expensive item in the same order.

              " \"ACCOUNT NAME/ XXXX XXXX CREDIT CARD/ XXXX  Mastercard It's ridiculous any company employees would keep a customer on the phone so long they become ill. I've never in all of my years dealt with any company that penalize customers for paying off a credit card. This credit card company called XXXX does just that penalize you for paying your card off not only that they'll hold your payment when you pay with a debit card. Clearly this credit card company XXXX   would rather customers stay in debt and keep a balance instead of paying their balance off each month. Once this complaint is over and it may take a hit on my credit score but i'll surely be closing this account. \\n\\nOnXX/XX/2019 i made a payment for {$460.00} to my credit card. I made the payment well before XXXX XXXX CST/XXXX XXXX EST   so my payment should've posted at midnight yet it didn't. When i called in on XX/XX/2019 to see why my payment had not posted. I was then told by a representative name XXXX it would be on hold for 3 days. I asked him why and he continued to put the phone down when i asked. He provoked me to the point yes i became irate and asked for a supervisor. I sat on hold for 20 minutes because XXXX LIED and said i dod n't ask for one when i did. He finally got a supervisor who's name was XXXX as well. I asked this XXXX why my payment didn't post and he told me because i paid more than 50 % of my credit limit which my credit limit is {$700.00}. Then he tells me it didn't post but it will in 4 business days which this information IS NOT on their website, it's not in their terms and conditions, nor is it anywhere on their app that they will with-hold your payment if you pay too much or if you pay 50 % of your credit Limit. This makes no sense and the only time i've known for a company to with-hold a payment is when you pay by check NOT by debit card which are suppose to automatically post. Then the supervisor stated my payment didn't post because i haven't had my account opened long. This is very deceptive to customers to not have this anywhere the customers can read it or see it. \\n\\nI've included 2 screenshots. One shows the text message stating my payment had posted. The other screenshot shows the time frame for a payment to post which DOES NOT state if you pay too much they'll with-hold your payments.\",\n",
              " 'XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX In XX/XX/XXXX I called the Best Buy ( citibank ) Credit Card customer support to get a payoff amount, make payment and close the account. This was completed at that time, amount/payment made/closed account. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX Best Buy/citibank withdrew {$190.00} in autopay on a paid off, closed account. I called customer support immediately upon seeing this on my banks app. I was told then that it was a mistake and would be refunded within 10 days. \\n\\nNo refund was completed so I called back, asked to speak to a supervisor and was again told it would be 7-10 days. On the XX/XX/XXXX, I  received an email from Citi that the refund was being processed and should be in my account within 3 days. \\n\\nNo refund appeared within the timeframe so I called again, they gave me a account number the refund went to which was not mine, nor the account the money had been withdrawn from. After advising them of their inaccuracy and reproviding the correct account number, I asked how and why this could happen, the account had been set up on autopay and the {$190.00} they withdrew was from the same account I had just re provided. Again I was told 7-10 days.\\n\\nI called again the following week and requested to be transferred to the next level management as every answer was becoming 7-10 days.\\n\\nUpon reaching the Executive response team, they agreed that they made the mistake both by withdrawing the money to begin with but also for refunding it to \"\" some other account which was not mine \\'\\'. I was told by that team that they had another 7-10 days to review and work on the issue. \\n\\nI received a call ( the first callback during this issue ) on the XX/XX/XXXX from the executive response team stating that the only issue left was for her to get verbal confirmation from me that I did not have an account ending in XXXX ( the account they sent the money to ), I confirmed and restate here that I do not have an account ending in those numbers. Her response was that she would rush that confirmation to the \"\" other office in charge of disbursements \\'\\' and to expect the refund in my correct account within 5-7 days. \\n\\nUpon yet again not receiving the refund I called today XXXX and again spoke with my executive account specialist ( XXXX ) XXXX, she advised me she had been given bad information and that they also needed to recover the money from the erroneous account prior to paying me back for their error. \\n\\n( I would like to reiterate that even today Citi confirms they made a mistake, they know I don\\'t own the account they supposedly sent the money to, that they will not refund their mistake-my money until they get theirs back ). \\n\\nDuring this phone conversation which they record, my specialist also informed me that : 1. She now had a response date/iou to me to get back to me by XXXX. \\n2. They/Citi can\\'t/wo n\\'t as a matter of policy refund me until they secure their money first.\\n\\n3. They have no ability to find anything out about the account they sent it to as they do not know who owns it, nor can the receiving bank give out information without the account owners approval, but she has until the XXXX to get back to me, they sent the receiving bank a letter and \"\" I hope they can help \\'\\'. \\n\\nI requested to speak to the next level of management as I simply could not believe a company as large as Citi could do business in such a way. She told me the next level was the office manager but he wouldn\\'t have access to my account. I said that was fine I would still like to speak to him. She then asked me why as he had no account access? I stated he didn\\'t need to have account access, I wanted to ask him about policy. She then informed me that the office manager doesn\\'t speak to customers. I found these actions pretty telling and is what prompted me to contact Consumerfinance.gov.\\n\\nWe are currently on day 58 of this process as of XXXX and the only difference today from XX/XX/XXXX is that instead of the past 7-10 response time promised, Citi has done 2 things, one upped the time frame to 21 days and 2 advised me they won\\'t refund me until they get their money and they have no way to do that. Citi employees words not mine. \\n\\n\\nAny help you can provide on this will be greatly appreciated as I see this as fraud on the part of Citibank/Best Buy Credit institution.',\n",

I told the salesman that I refused to sign that because it said 12 mos. not 18. \\n\\n\\nHe said he it was wrong, took it to the back office, then returned. He said they put in the correction, that it is 18/mo for both of our orders, not to worry. He said paperwork would issue when the furniture was delivered. \\n\\nI informed him that I not sign anything that said 12/months. He not to worry. He gave me his card and cell number if I had a problem. \\n\\nThe bed set was delivered, nothing mentioned 12/mos.

However, since opening the account, I sent consistently and monthly sent a payment of {$100.00} until my last payment of {$150.00} was paid in full. All payments were sent via XXXX XXXX Bill Pay monthly with the last payment on XX/XX/XXXX. After sending in my last payment, I received another invoice in XXXX reflecting a late fee of {$27.00} charged to my account. In XXXX I received another invoice with the past due balance of {$27.00} late fee plus a second late fee of {$29.00} making it a total of {$56.00}. Within the last two weeks, I have been getting daily calls from Citicorp regarding the past due late fees not being paid. Today, XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with a rep at Citicorp about this and he stated that I should call Best Buy to resolve this issue. However, I did write and explain to Customer Service at Best Buy on XX/XX/XXXX explaining the exact issue mentioned here. No one from customer service has responded to this matter. Yet I continue to get harassing calls on a daily basis regarding my account being past due. It was paid in FULL when the last payment of {$150.00} was sent on XX/XX/XXXX via XXXX XXXX Bill Pay and posted on XX/XX/XXXX as reflected by Best Buy in their last invoice to me received XX/XX/XXXX. In my letter dated XX/XX/XXXX sent to Best Buy I requested my account be closed and that the late fees be credited off my account. Best Buy previously stated that the payment was received one day late. It was received and posted on XX/XX/XXXX, by Best Buy but sent by XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX via EFT bill pay. Best Buy stated to me that it should have been paid by XX/XX/XXXX. One day late and I am being harassed to pay them late fees now. It appears that late fees are continuing to accrue monthly on an account I paid in full in XX/XX/XXXX and that no one has responded to my written correspondence sent to Best Buy, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, MO XXXX. I\\'m being ignored and harassed for late fees on a closed account which was paid in full and which payment was received in full one day late per Best Buy.

Thus I was told on XX/XX/XXXX that I had to wait until my statement close to see my cash rewards on my account which was XX/XX/XXXX, each time that I contact customer service I am told I have to wait another thirty days or until my statement close date.

They lied, claiming their product received the highest praise from the TV show XXXX XXXX and included false articles and photos. I was presented with a pop-up web site advertising a free sample, just pay {$5.00} shipping. I figured it was worth the risk. Well, it was not. I received a fake order, package with advertisements only and then a new {$84.00} charge. I disputed the charges and reported my card lost/stolen. Chase removed the {$5.00} charge but refuses to remove the {$84.00} charge. Chase claims I signed up for a subscription. XXXX changed their web site and offer after the sale. I have not received any product or services from XXXX and I emailed them requesting a refund about a month ago. No response! CHASE fraud services told me ... and I quote \"\" Using my credit card is as good as cash \\'\\' and \"\" once I provide my card number to a merchant I am giving them permission to charge whatever they want \\'\\' This is absurd. Top it off, the first time I called XXXX about the dispute they knew the details immediately without research. The representative was reading the \"\" terms and conditions \\'\\' of my order with XXXX. I asked them where they were reading this from and was told \"\" from their web site \\'\\' I went to the web site and it required signing in before you could read the terms and conditions. It was a completely different site from what I had seen when I ordered the free sample. How could Chase have known all the details within seconds?? Because they know the scam and protecting the scammers. \\nThe only reason I fell for this scam, after reading every minute detail and being skeptical ... was because I trusted that if it was a scam that I could simply dispute the charge.

I had not heard back anything from Walmart soXX/XX/2019 I decided to call again and check to see if my interest rate can be lowered due to the Federal Reserve lowering interest rates just recently and I was advised by a Rep that no it could not be lowered, I talked to Account Manager XXXX who reread the same script that I had been told in XX/XX/XXXX. This is making it extremely difficult to clear my debt with them and it\\'s unfair to consumers when the Feds lower interest rates but Walmart Synchrony Bank will not follow the same protocol, I\\'m paying XXXX bucks a month in interest alone which is beyond ridiculous, please investigate\\n\"My Capital One credit cards have been in a restricted status for over a year with no separate adverse action letter sent. I called on XX/XX/19 to find out what was going on and was finally told that my accounts were permanently restricted and Id never regain charges privileges.

I reported them. On XX/XX/2019, I received a call from Discover dispute investigations who asked me a few questions and told me I should file a police report. I asked for the information they had and a supervisor named XXXX told me he would send me all of the documents. I never received any documents at all. On XX/XX/2019, Discover decided that the charges were valid even though it is impossible that I made them. I asked for proof and they can\\'t provide me with any proof or documents. The burden is on them to prove that I made these charges and they will not show me what they are using to justify the decision that I made them ( most likely because there is no evidence ). Now my account is overdrawn and I can not pay my bills or book necessary business travel because of this. The Deposit Agreement says I have zero liability for fraud.\\nTo whom it may concern, I am very distressed having to write this letter but I see no other way to resolve this issue. On XX/XX/XXXX I decided to get a loan to pay off my credit cards. My Barclay card was to be paid off at XXXX dollars. The bank distributed the checks to the various creditors ; I provide the statement payment stubs with the corresponding envelopes. Somehow the Barclay payment never made it were it was going. All payments were made with official bank checks. When I received my XX/XX/XXXX bill from Barclay I noticed the {$3100.00} payment was not there. I just figured it had not posted yet. When I got my XX/XX/XXXX bill and it still hadn\\'t posted I contacted my bank they retrieved the canceled check and called Barclay. The bank has faxed and emailed the canceled check to Barclay several times. Barclay finally came up with the answer that the check had gone to the wrong bank, were some of their accounts had been sold too. The bank and I have been calling Barclay Almost every week to no avail. I was told in XX/XX/XXXX when the investigation started I would not be charged late fees or interest until the matter was solved. I on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXXBarclay called 5 to 6 times I returned their called assuming they were going to tell me the problem was solved, they informed me I owed them a XXXX past due payment .I informed them as far as I was concerned they were paid off I have a canceled check made out to Barclay . We have been dealing with this since XX/XX/XXXX every time you call them you get someone different to speak too, the last supervisor I spoke to tried to get a specialist to speak to me, he was told none were available.

I am not sure how this happened, I believe that I had made my payments to you when I received my statements. My only thought is that my monthly statement did not get to me.\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I called synchrony bank and spoke to several managers and employees and finally spoke to supposedly the highest manager XXXX employee ID XXXX. I requested a copy of my XXXX billing statement but was unable to receive a copy to this day. I had misplaced the original copy mailed to me and didnt realize it would be pure XXXX to obtain another copy otherwise I would have secured it. XXXX advised they do not email fax text or any other format other than mail will send me a copy of my billing. Also the mailed copy can only be received 7-14 business days. The issue I explained I had was I was closing on a mortgage of a home purchase and needed the documents within 3 days. I was advised they can only fed ex it to me 3-5 business days as the only other alternative. I expressed how urgently I needed my own statement but no employee nor the manager cared. He spoke with attitude and could care less about my issue. I am not asking for much just my own statement and as a creditor it should be their responsibility to provide documents quickly and efficiently. I was unable to purchase the home due to lack of this documentation. I asked for an online option through their online application but they advised because I was not previously signed up for the online billing even though I signed up on XX/XX/XXXX they still would not send me a XXXX statement. I am furious and want this to be addressed. I asked for my terms and agreement where it says they will refuse sending me documents if I need them quicker and received a letter from them with terms that I read and do not include any explanation for why they can not send it electronically to me or fed ex over one day. In fact I to this day have not received a copy of my XXXX statement. This is unacceptable! I asked how I can complain from XXXX the manager and he gave me only the address XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Utah XXXX and I sent them a letter. He had no phone number to provide.\\nMy XXXX I have had for 3 plus years and have never ever ever missed a payment and always paid in time. I have never asked for extensions and I always pay a little more than minimum due. My credit limit was {$8900.00}, which I have never been close to reaching and Barclaycard automatically went ahead and dropped it to {$6100.00}. Now they have hurt my credit report by showing my credit usage has gone extremely up and I feel that is very shady and uncalled for being that I am a long term customer and have been loyal and paid my bill on time every single month. Now my credit report is affected. I have no unpaid debts, EVERY SINGLE one of my credit cards or store cards are paid on every single month. I have a very steady job no gaps in that, no bankruptcy, no payday loans, no outstanding doctor bills even and this company does this to me. I feel this is very very wrong and at the least they should move it back to the {$8900.00} as they are causing harm to my credit report. I have reached out to them and got no response, I would like this fixed. I have attached my information from my credit report showing I am in very good standing with this company AND even shows I have never been late and pay my bills. Once this is reported in XXXX by Barclaycard they will have done major impact to my credit report and score and that is not right at all. I am at no risk not paying my bills and never have. My own bank account is never in the negative either!! This is not right at all\\nI was shocked when reviewing my credit report and found a late payment on the date below : 30 days late as of XX/XX/2020 I am not sure how this happened. I believe I made my payments to you when I received my statements. My only thought is that my statement did not get to me.\\n\"I called to the Capital One costumer service more than 4 times for my XXXX Credit Card, the third time on XX/XX/2019, which took more that 3 hours explaining the issue, finally got disconnected when I was on hold for more than 1 hour by the Costumer service Supervisor who wanted to confirm the issue with another departments. \\nOnce I didn\\'t called back again I called back on XX/XX/2019 and just informed that they put a note on my account that \"\" everything is correct. \\'\\' The issue is very simple, I explained in detail more than 10 times but it looks like there is not an intention to pay attention to my issue : Let assume today is XX/XX/2019 : I simply downloaded all of my transactions form Capital one website : 1- I summed Total ( Year to date ) posted Expenses 2- I summed Total ( Year to date ) posted Payments ( including Reward Redemption ) 3- I calculated Total ( Year to date ) Remaining Balance by extracting item 2 from Item 1.\\n\\nThe result it is showing a negative number which means I paid beyond the debts but surprisingly my available credit limit is still under the credit limit. \\nI am attaching here an transactions Excel spreadsheet which is clarifying my claim.\"\\nWhen I recently applied for a new mortgage it was discovered that my identity had been stolen and someone had opened a Nordstrom store card under my information and then purchased items, charged-off, and was sold to collections. I notified the 3 Credit Reporting Agencies and Nordstrom \\'s fraud department. The fraud department had me send a photocopy of my ID in along with a statement that the purchases were not mine and that I had not opened a card with them. I have tried to follow up several times with the Fraud department and each time they repeat that they have been sending physical mail which I am not receiving. They have also claimed I will need to work with the collections company separately. The issue is Nordstrom is the party responsible for not performing due diligence and issuing fraudulent credit and then selling that fraudulent credit to a 3rd party.  Nordstrom should be responsible AND helpful in the process. My credit report shows all paid as agreed ( never a single delinquency ) prior to this fraud. I would also expect them to be able to pull the location the card was opened such as physical store or IP address to show it was not me.\\n\"Discover card advertized promotional rates and I applied. Got approved for {$4500.00} credit line. They run my credit which is excellent. I got email \"\" congratulations, you card is in the mail \\'\\', than I received completely fraudulent request for my tax returns release from XXXX. I called Discover and they explained that they just implemented brand new policy of requesting tax reutrns AFTER they approve credit card. This policy is complete fraud. After all those security breaches at XXXX, XXXX, Credit Card acompanies and banks, you got to be completely insane to release your taxes to them. \\nMost importantly, Discover DID NOT DSCLOSE PRIOR TO applying and running my hard credit check that they will be requiring my tax returns release. if they had disclosed prior to taking my application that they have new policy of requesting release of consumer \\'s tax returns thru recently hacked Equifax, I would have never applied. I requested they remove the credit check from my credit reports and they refused. I beleive this practice is FRAUDULENT.\"\\nOn XX/XX/2019, I learned a credit account had been opened in my name at Barclays Bank. The card had an outstanding balance of {$15000.00}. I called Barclays Bank to notify them of the fraudulent account and was told they would investigate. I completed an Identity Theft Report at the Federal Trade Commission website. I printed the report, sent it to Barclays along with a letter requesting the account be closed and reported as fraudulent to the credit bureaus. I froze my credit report at all 3 credit bureaus and mailed them the identity theft report along with a request the account be removed from my credit report. On XX/XX/2019 I filed a incident report at my local police precinct and a police report was issued. I faxed the police report to Barclays on XX/XX/2019, then followed up with a phone to Barclays on XX/XX/2019. When I called I gave the representative the name and contact information for the Detective assigned to the case. As a result of the Detective \\'s investigation an arrest warrant was issued, an arrest made, and a guilty plea entered in court. The guilty plea was entered on XX/XX/2019. On XX/XX/2019, Barclays called me to inform me they had completed their investigation and determined the account was valid. On XX/XX/2019, I faxed additional documentation to Barclays, including a letter for the US District Attorney \\'s office documenting the guilty plea on the charge of credit card fraud. On XX/XX/2019, I called Barclays to follow up, according to the representative, the documentation faxed XX/XX/2019 had not been reviewed, but would be forwarded to the investigations team. The account remains under review. Over the last 3 months, I have received 2 letters from Barclays stating their investigation was complete and the account is valid. I have spoken with multiple representative who claim that purchases made with the card, including groceries, were household items and therefore I am responsible for the account. Every time I call Barclays, I am place on hold multiple times, transferred at least twice or asked to call back at another number. When I call, I never speak to the same representative more than once.\\nI have a military star card with an unknown minimum payment. This account has been open since XXXX of XXXX. I pay the full, or at least half of the statement balance each month through the mobile app. A late payment remark was put on my credit report in XXXX of XXXX.

I immediately called Regions Bank because I noticed fraudulent activity on my account. I was told that since these charges were pending, I had to wait until the charges were approved in order to file a dispute. I then cancelled my debit card and ordered another card because I was not familiar with the charges. I knew I had been scammed! I then called Regions Bank and filed a complaint. While filing the complaint, I was told that I would be contacted within 10 days on a decision concerning the claim. After several weeks on receiving no answer, I called Regions and I was informed that I would not be receiving a refund because they deemed the charges authorized from the account holder. I vehemently disagreed with them and tried to resolve this issue. Those particular funds were sent to a \"\" XXXX XXXX \\'\\' of which I do not own. There are a total of 11 consecutive charges on my debit card which is in itself suspicious. I would like these funds returned to me because I did not give any authorization to anyone whatsoever to charge me over and over of XXXX dollars! I was obviously scammed and Regions Bank is failing to see this. Again, I made no such purchases, neither did I give anyone permission to charge my card over and over for {$8.00}. Why would I then contact Regions immediately when I saw suspicious activity.\"\\nI was a victim of identity theft between the timeframe of XXXX a gentleman by the name of XXXX XXXX stole my identity and my father as well and opened fraudulent accounts like auto loans, credit cards, and business credit cards as well.

The merchant never produced any valid documentation.\\nCitibank has recently closed my credit card accounts\\n\"In XXXX I lost a credit card and had to cancel it once I realized it was missing, i only realized this because it was used and I didn\\'t use it. I had also applied for a new license which I never received in the mail and had to go back to the dmv to reapply and than In late XX/XX/2019 I realized I was a victim of Identity fraud. I didn\\'t realize this till logging onto my credit score with XXXX XXXX. I saw new remarks and credit cards that I did not apply for ... some showing in early to Mid XXXX, I did as the app said to contact the credit bureaus. After placing fraud alerts on my accounts I decided then to put a freeze on all 3 credit bureaus early XXXX, when more accounts started to show on my credit report. This continued to happen again thou, another 3 accounts showed up ... I was told that there wasn\\'t a time limit on when they would register to show to my credit page, it was possible it was done before the freeze and I should once again take the appropriate steps. So I did, but the last of these creditors that showed was Conn \\'s dba Conn \\'s appliance inc. I contacted the bureaus first as I did with every situation that arose during this time and than reached out to the actual creditor. This time trying to reach a representative seemed more difficult. But after a few days I got a hold of a customer service rep who said that the fraud dept was closed but she could note my account and someone would contact me. This never happened so I tried again, this time though I had an actual notice in the mail from this company, I used this information to finally get in touch with Conn \\'s, I finally got transferred to the fraud dept of this creditor. Shortly after I received an email from this department stating what I needed to do next for this claim. Within 36 hrs I had filled out there paperwork had it notarized and went to XXXX to fill out a police report. Some weeks had passed by so I used the email information to contact them back, the rep said my claim was still pending but should be processed by the end of the week. It was not, before I could contact them again the XXXX called me to see if the situation had be rectified and it had not. So I reached back out again but this time I was told a letter of my status to the claim was mailed to me the week before. I never received it. So they sent it to me via email. And I felt devastated and violated all over again. Conn \\'s appliance Inc dba Conn \\'s denied my claim.  and the reason they denied my claim made no sense to me. They denied it with the very definition of what identity theft means. \\nThey said \"\" Name, DOB, DL number, expiration date, address and signature on the DL provided with the fraud affidavit and the DL used to open the account matched. Signed by XXXX XXXX Fraud Investigator-Conn \\'s Home Plus. \\nI quickly responded to the email that I wanted to appeal this claim, but got no response. I tried contacting the number on the letter but the recording said it couldn\\'t help me at this time and quickly disconnected me. \\nI tried emailing again this morning and haven\\'t received a response yet again. I than tried the phone number again this morning and got a voice mail. \\nThis account was open without my knowledge or permission or consent. \\nI\\'am a VICTIM of identity theft.',\n",

I didn\\'t realize it was stolen until about a week later. I called and requested a new card, and the agent did not go over the transactions pending on the account, so I had no idea there was an unauthorized charge. The charge was done on XX/XX/XXXX for {$8.00} at XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX, FL. ( Yes, the charge is at a key-making kiosk ... pretty sure their MCC code has nothing to do with medical services or products, so it should have never been approved in the first place. ) On XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed I\\'d received a notice to provide documentation for a pending claim from YSA. On that day, I provided the first notice ( attached as Flex Card Stolen.pdf ) that the card in question was unauthorized. Per Regulation E, YSA had 10 business days from that date to provide provisional credit and begin their investigation. I then received another notice on XX/XX/XXXX that the information provided was insufficient and I needed to provide receipts and documentation to prove the eligibility of the charge. At that time I contacted the company via phone and made another claim of fraud. They claimed I needed to fill out a form ; however, on the form they said I needed to fill it, it clearly states that instead of the form, I can provide them with a written explanation of the nature of my dispute. As such, I again provided a more detailed notice on that date ( XX/XX/XXXX ) detailing the unauthorized nature of the transaction. I have again received the same vague notice on XX/XX/XXXX that more information is required. As such, I have filled out their form and uploaded it to the site. Since the transaction is unauthorized, there is no other information I can provide. I find this process to be unnecessarily burdensome ( quite frankly ridiculous, just like every interaction with Your Spending Account ) and in violation of my rights under Regulation E.\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I was working at XXXX XXXX XXXX doing a laundry reset. ( i did make a purchase there for XXXX ) My phone was charging in the car so I went to go get it and noticed I had several notifications from Chase asking if I made a purchase at a gas station for XXXX. I immediately said no I called them and replied to the email. Informing them that I did not make this transaction they cancelled my card and started a claim and credited the money back the following day. XX/XX/XXXX I recieved a letter saying that they deemed the transaction authorized. And that on XX/XX/XXXX they will take the funds back out of my account. I immediately called them and the rep told me that because I could have done it because I was in the vincity of that location. I told him that from where I was it was a good XXXX minutes away and that it wasn\\'t me. I asked if I could send proof like pictures. He said say yes. So I did. I went back to the store took pictures and recorded myself in their computer of me working, it shows my in the laundry aisle working at the time the transaction happened. Their was no way to send the video so I sent pictures. Waited about a week and half to see if they recieved it, I even called about 3 times different days to see if they got it. After they recieved it I waited about a day and called them back, he said that it was declined again. I asked why he said because I had previous history with the merchant. I advise him that I rarely if ever go to that XXXX and I havent gotten gas from them in awhile, I spoke to someone higher and all she said was the claim was denied, their is nothing they can do. I refused to give up so I contacted XXXX XX/XX/XXXX to try and get this resolved he ( XXXX XXXX ) told me to give him a couple days I waited a week so I called back he then told me to file a police report becuSe he cant look at the cameras unless he has a report. So today XX/XX/XXXX I got one I sent it to him he then messages me back 20 minutes later saying that they don\\'t have any footage and that XXXX is unable to assist.

Secondly, I didn\\'t even receive any refund back for 2 months until I called and asked them about it. There was no way for me to know about this incident, except the day before boarding the flight.

I am familiar with the Unfair, Deceptive, Abusive Acts or Practices part of the Dodd-Frank Bill. This should certainly apply in how this company is conducting its business here. If they can not prove the validity, of this account, if it is unverifiable, they should delete it. They are violating the law otherwise. Also, along the lines of the XXXX, the account is listed as being charged-off back in XXXX, yet in XXXX they added another {$160.00} on what strongly appears to be another violation. And they list a credit limit of {$8600.00} to an account that is allegedly closed and have it listed on a couple of my credit reports at 73 % usage. I would imagine if the account was actually closed and subsequently charged-off the term usage in this matter would fall under being a deceptive act.\"\\nOn XX/XX/, 2019 I had received a notification my credit score had gone down which I am in the process of purchasing a home and can not have it go down, so I logged online to see the reason it had gone down and the notification stated I had one of my credit cards maxed out to be specific my JCPenny Store Credit Card maxed out. I was confused and thought to myself this is clearly fraud because I dont have my JCPenny Credit Card maxed out and the notification continued to say make a payment and bring the balance down to bring your credit score back up. I immediately called JCPenny customer service XXXX at XXXX central standard time on XX/XX/, 2019. I explain to the customer service representative that it shows me maxed out on my credit card and this is wrong and clearly fraud and she stated it was correct that they changed my credit limit to {$280.00}. I asked her on what grounds did they change it and this is deceptive business practices because they did not inform me that they had changed it or why, that I received not notification whatsoever. I told her that as a consumer who agreed to a certain amount when I initially applied for the card a year ago and allowed them to run my credit a year ago and was approved for {$500.00} that this has been my a credit amount this entire time. I told her I have never paid late or gone over my credit limit. The representative said that is correct you were approved for {$500.00} about a year ago and never paid late and said however we have a system that monitors your spending habits and will match your credit line to your spending habits, so I tell the representative okay let me make sense of what you are saying and said since I dont max out my card or use the {$500.00} every month your system is monitoring my spending habits and your system changed my credit limit to match my actual spending amount and she said yes. I tell the representative again this is deceptive business practices to monitor my spending or any consumers spending and based on those grounds they changed my credit limit and thats where I have an issue because it was changed without my knowledge and this hurt my credit score. I told her because you monitored my spending and changed my limit to what I actually spend which is roughly {$280.00} a month and me having a balance of {$270.00} has a negative impact on me and this information reports to credit bureau as a card maxed out and to make a payment to bring balance down and this would then raise your credit score and thats where I have a problem and issue with these deceptive business practices. This company completed deceptive business practices by monitoring my spending but to change my credit limit based on spending habits and not inform the consumer is deceptive and wrong. The representative apologizes and says we can raise it again but to raise a credit limit we have to run your credit report again which I declined and told her why would I run my credit report again to have the same limit I initially started with. I told her I gave you permission to run it a year ago and agreed to a certain amount and for what for you to monitor my spending and just change it. I informed her I was gon na file a complaint because they did not notify me in any way, shape or form and if it was not because of my alert from credit bureaus that there had been a change to credit score I would never have known the amount changed. I told her I could have decided to purchase something for someone as a gift and my card would have been declined and again she apologizes and says lets run your credit score again to raise it back up for you. This has been the most deceptive act I have ever come across, for your spending habits to be monitored and your credit line changed based on those grounds.\\nA few months ago I had a dip in my credit score which Caused Bank of America to make the decision to close my Credit Card account that I help with them. At that time, I had not made one late payment to THEM but because of my scores, they closed my card. I called a few times to try and fix the situation because their actions further affected my credit which is not fair to me as a consumer. I am now on the hook for over {$2500.00} on a card that was closed because of no fault of my own.\\n\"This is in reference to complaint # XXXX, which has previously been filed and closed on XX/XX/XXXX. However the issue is still unresolved. \\n\\nThe comments below all relate directly to Capital One \\'s response to my complaint.\\n\\n1 ) The letter does not provide the date the final payment is due before interest will be charged. Rather is only says XX/XX/XXXX.

Now their letter says it is due in XX/XX/XXXX but does not provide a specific date. Why is it that each time Capital One responds to this question the date it is due gets shortened? \\n\\n3 ) A representative from Capital One called me in early XXXX and left a voice mail to call back. When I did I found I was calling they general customer service line. After holding for 10 minutes, then re-explaining why I was call, then being placed on hold, the representative finally came back on to the line and told me a letter was being mailed. Presumably the letter attached to their response. However I have NEVER actually received this letter.\\n\\n4 ) On XX/XX/XXXX I received a call from another representative, this time from the \"\" Executive Office \\'\\' wanting to discuss case # XXXX. I have called the number provided, XXXX, extension # XXXX, at least 5 times and left voice mail messages with my phone number.

The closed account now has a credit balance but Chase has not refunded the credit balance to me.\\n\"On XX/XX/XXXX of 2021 I discovered that my XXXX Rewards Visa Account with JP Morgan Chase had been closed without warning or explanation. At this time there had never been a single late or missed payment on this account and no payment was even due. Upon calling JP Morgan Chase believing this to be a mistake I was informed that the department I needed to speak to was closed and due to the holiday weekend I would have to wait until Tuesday. \\n\\nUpon contacting the number provided I explained what had happened to the employee at JP Morgan Chase who seemed to be just as baffled as confused as I was and agreed that they did not understand it as well and asked me to bear with them several times as they continued to search through my account trying to discover why this had happened. The employee eventually said that they found the reason for the closure of my account and that it was in a letter and then asked if I had gotten the letter to which I had not and told him this. \\n\\nThe employee working for JP Morgan Chase proceeded to tell me that Chase had received a letter from XXXX ( whom I had a paid credit monitoring service through at the time ) sent them a letter ordering them to close my account. I was so confused I didnt even know what to think and asked several questions including how XXXX had the power to close my account to which he said he did not know, what contact information was included in the letter to which he claimed he was unable to share, if I could have a copy of the letter to which he refused, and what I needed to do next to which he said I had to contact XXXX to resolve the issue because they are the ones that closed my account. \\n\\nAfter speaking to multiple departments of XXXX over the next several days there was not a single employee who had ever heard of such a thing and told me very boldy that I had been lied to. This led me to believe that some kind of fraud or identity theft had taken place and no matter who I talked to at JP Morgan Chase NOBODY would help me or give me ANY kind of information. \\n\\nThis put me in a state of fear and terrified to use kind of debit or credit cards at this point so I locked everything and froze my credit report until I could get some answers. These were answers that never came. Instead all I have received from JP Morgan Chase and its employees have been lies that caused an immense amount of damage not only to my credit report, my means of living, ability to pay bills and try to survive through the pandemic the world is suffering through, but most importantly my own well being. \\n\\nI made dozens of attempts to contact JP Morgan Chase between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX all of which ended with me either being transferred to a dead line, hung up on, or my favorite of being re assured I was being transferred to an actual person in a department that would only be a recorded message and then hang up on me. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I had an alert that a payment did not go through to JP Morgan Chase. At this time I chose to use their online secured message feature to contact them in regards to it and much to surprise I actually received an answer so I decided to use this form of communication in regards to my closed account. \\n\\nAfter more than a dozen messages have been exchanged I have been given multiple phone numbers to contact during specific business hours ( all of which have led straight to a recording that says they are closed and hangs up during the times given ), and been told that my inquiry has been escalated to a manager, been notified that this has been sent an investigator to determine a resolution. \\n\\nNone of these things have happened. The only contact Chase has made with me has been automated phone calls and when transferred to a live person they dont have any clue what I am even referring to. I have not received a single email from an individual, a letter in the mail, a phone call or any form of contact from an investigator, or had a single person leave a message saying they were trying to get in contact with me. \\n\\nI believe this to be very unacceptable from the very beginning when their employee lied to me about the reason for the closure of my account all the way up until now where it has been more than 2 months and I still have not received any truth from JP Morgan Chase. \\n\\nIn fact all that I have received from this company is an immense amount of damage to my life as a direct result of the actions of JP Morgan Chase and their employees, extensive damage to my credit history and report, multiple financial hardships directly related to this entire situation that they have refused to resolve or even take interest in, and my own mental well-being that has been severely affected by this entire situation caused by JP Morgan Chase and its employees. \\n\\n[ Electronic Messages Exchanged Are Attached ]',\n",
              " 'Netspend Fraud - XX/XX/2020 ( XXXX XXXX ) I believe I am a victim of fraud by Netspend or by people creating fraudulent Netspend credit card accounts under my name. I need help resolving this issue as all my attempts to do so through the company have been unsuccessful. Please provide guidance to me. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/2020, I got four emails in a row starting around XXXX ET, over the course of 5 minutes, from noreply@netspend.com. The emails were NOT encrypted ( seems very unusual for such emails ) and each contained a security code, like someone was trying to reset a password or enter an account fraudulently. I had previously never heard of Netspend. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/2020, I went online ( https : //www.netspend.com/help/contact/ ) and called Netspend to look into the situation and try to put an end to any fraudulent activity, which I was very concerned about. Before being able to talk with a customer service representative, the automated phone options ( XXXX ) force you to enter either a Netspend account number or your full social security number. I dont have any account with Netspend and I was calling to close any possible fraudulent account, and there was no way I was going to give over my full social security number given my concerns. \\n\\nUnable to reach a customer service representative on the phone, I emailed one of Netspends supposed fraud complaint emails ( spoof@netspend.com ) writing them : I never applied for this card, do not want a card, and believe this represents fraud. It needs to be investigated and the account closed immediately.\\n\\nI tried calling your phone number, but there is no way to reach someone if you don\\'t have an account ( or maybe even if you do ). Unbelievable.\\n\\nThere was no response from Netspend. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/2020, I got an email at XXXX XXXX ET from card@email.netspend.com stating that Your Netspend card is on the way, although I never requested a card nor would I ever request one with Netspend. The email stated that my Netspend Visa Prepaid Card has been shipped and is on its way to you. Once your card arrives, be sure to activate it and verify your identity. * After that, add money to your Card Account and then use your card to buy groceries, pay bills,1 and shop online! \\n\\nI got similar emails from Netspend on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from Netspend stating : thank you for requesting your new Netspend Visa Prepaid Card. Don\\'t forget to activate your Card Account and verify your identity! \\n\\nI noticed that the different emails from Netspend included information stating my email address ( although written differently than I typically type it ) as well as the last digits of the supposed prepaid card. However, some emails included four digits, while other emails included just three digits. \\n\\nOn the morning of XX/XX/XXXX, I spent an hour on the phone between XXXX and XXXX trying to reach a customer representative at the customer service number. I entered digits for a social security code ( although I made them up ) when faced with the automated phone system requiring a social security number. Then, after waiting for 10 minutes, I finally reached a representative who immediate started saying she couldnt hear me. I said I could hear her and that I was calling to look into a problem, but she continued to talk over me and then returned me to the automated phone system again.\\n\\nI called back and used the same method to get to another representative. Again, they asked how they could help me, then subsequently said, If you can hear me caller, please respond. I said I could hear him and asked if he could hear me and that I was calling to report a problem, but he kept repeating the same thing over and over several times, like from a script. And then the line went dead and I was in silence. \\n\\nBoth interactions seemed very contrived. I believe they could, in fact, hear me and that his was just part of the scam. I have never had any audio issue with my phone and successfully made and received calls with other callers the same day without any audio issues. \\n\\nAfter my frustrating phone calls with Netspend, I then wrote an email at XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX to the XXXX  of Netspend ( XXXX ), and email address that is posted at https : //www.netspend.com/help/contact/ for complaints or compliments. In my email I wrote again that I had never applied for a card, did not want a card, and that I felt this represented fraud and that it needed to be investigated and the account closed immediately. I reported that I had tried to call severals times, but that I had encountered the problems described above with the automated phone system asking for impossible or sensitive information, and then representatives who appeared to be pretending not to hear me while reading from a script. At the end of my email, I wrote that I planned to submit complaints to the Consumer Protection Bureau, the Better Business Bureau, and perhaps law enforcement.\\n\\nI received an automated reply from donotreply@netspend.com at XXXX stating : Thank you for contacting the Netspend Corporate Office . Your concern is important to us and one of our analysts will respond to you within three business days.\\n\\nWe are closely monitoring the latest news about the current global emergency. We are open, but are currently experiencing extended wait times to speak with our customer service agents.

Ive tried to dispute this with them several times and they refused to do anything about it. If anyone take a close and careful look at my payment history with this company or any other company on my credit profile Ive never been late or missed a payment. The statements was being sent to an address I had no association with. They have me paying on time with XXXX in the month of XX/XX/XXXX but 30 days with the XXXX and XXXX. Then 30 days late with XXXX in the month of XX/XX/XXXX but in the same month 60days late with the XXXX and XXXX. 60 days late with XXXX in the month XX/XX/XXXX but 90 days late with with the XXXX   and XXXX. In the month XX/XX/XXXX XXXX 90days late but now we have on time payments with the XXXX and XXXX. So as you can see the information have been reported incorrectly the entire time they was sending the billing statements to wrong address. Now they want me to pay the price for they mistakes ... All I want is for the all the late payments to be removed. For a loyal customer since XX/XX/XXXX with no late payments ever. I feel that them making a an adjustment to correct the late payment will be very satisfying to a loyal customer. All late payments should be removed immediately. Reporting inaccurate information is terms for deletion according to FCRA.\\nOn XX/XX/2019, I returned from overseas, to find my Comenity Capital Bank Mastercard was missing. I immediately checked my account online to find that charges totaling {$640.00} had been made, primarily to an XXXX online store for {$380.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, {$160.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. I advised Comenity that I was reporting fraud, the card was cancelled and a new one issued. My notification to them was on XX/XX/XXXX and yet my statement reflects an XXXX charge on XX/XX/XXXX. When I called Comenity on XX/XX/XXXX, I was told that I did not need to call XXXX as they would do it as part of the investigation. I received a letter from them on XX/XX/XXXX stating that my fraud claim is denied as they can find no basis to support my claim. That was the extent of their explanation, except to add that the more than {$600.00} in charges would be put back on my account. I called XXXX after receiving the letter. There were 3 credit card numbers issued to me before and after this fraud occurred. XXXX looked under all three credit card numbers, under my email address, and could find no order number, no tracking number and my email was not in their system. I had looked through all my emails-no record there. XXXX told me that the credit card company should be able to track the charges made, but I received no explanation that they had done so. I appears that there was no investigation. XXXX had no record of speaking to Comenity. Comenity never called me to follow up, other than the form letter they sent. I called the  number they gave me if I have any questions regarding the investigation, and after waiting on hold for 15 minutes, I began to discuss this with the representative that answered, and the phone connection was cut. I have laid all of this out in a letter to the company, sent to the address they directed in their letter. I also advised them that I was contacting you as this seems to me to be suspect. What kind of company sends a form letter that tells the victim of fraud no details of what they base a decision like this on. Either I was defrauded or I am committing fraud. Without anything to justify their position that I owe this money, I have appealed their decision.\\n\"CHASE Card Services closed my Account arguing DELINQUENCY OR DEROGATORY STATUS ON ACCOUNT WITH US. Because my Credit history and reports are impeccable, I do believe this was in reprisal for cancelling my wife \\'s and myself application for new VISA Cards. Such cards were suggested by MARRIOT Vacation Club agents ( BonVoy  ) to gain points in the BonVoy Program that we also cancelled as explained below. \\n\\nThe facts are as follows : 1. We ( My wife and I ) have hold a British Airways VISA card for the last 8 years. Since then, we have paid all our monthly balances in full and on time. The same is true for all and any of the credit cards that we currently have including CITI MasterCard, XXXX XXXX , XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  VISA ( Debit ), XXXX XXXX VISA ( Debit ). \\n\\n2. Our current credit score is XXXX, and we do not have any derogatory or delinquent items as the Chase letter suggests. \\n\\n3. In the last week of XX/XX/2019, we purchased a new Marriot Vacation Plan (  BonVoy ) costing about {$45000.00}. The selling agent suggested to us to apply for individual Marriot VISA cards to \"\" gain \\'\\' points that could be used to pay for vacations later. However, on XX/XX/2019, after testing the product and verifying that benefits described to us were not accurate, we decided to both cancelling purchase of the Plan and  withdrawing application for new VISA cards. \\n\\n4. On XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX we unsuccessfully tried to use out VISA cards, and on XX/XX/XXXX we received an unsigned notification stating that because of DELINQUENCY OR DEROGATORY STATUS ON ACCOUNT WITH US, CHASE has closed our Credit Card account. Although I called the credit card customer services, they stated that they could not give us any information because that was a decision made by CHASE. \\n\\n5. Since our Credit Card record is impeccable, and we do not have and haven\\'t had any delinquent or derogatory items ever with this or any other credit card or any other organization, I have concluded that the CHASE action against us was taken in reprisal for cancelling our applications for new cards that were suggested by Marriot. \\n\\n6. CHASE action resulted in embarrassing situations to my wife and myself when we were trying to pay for items we have purchased and CHASE denied payment without prior notice and subsequent refusal to provide us an explanation and identifying specific reason for their action.',\n",

I called and spoke to one of their representatives and asked if I could set up an automatic transfer from my savings to my credit card account to keep the account open, she said yes that would be acceptable. Once that payment date arrived the account had been closed out anyway. I attempted to speak to USAA about the issue and it took 3 phone calls to finally get to someone who was able to help. She was a member of the ceo relations team. She reviewed the phone calls and got back to me. She did acknowledge the fault lay with USAA and she would find a way to fix the issue. Over the next 2.5-3 months I didnt hear anything back. I attempted to contact her multiple times and was never able to get ahold of her. On one occasion I was on the phone for 45 minutes before someone could transfer me to the correct department. As they transferred me the call dropped and I never got a call back. I finally heard back from her last week and was told that they could reopen the card. I called yesterday and told her Id be able to open the account with a {$500.00} deposit, was told that wasnt a problem. She called back this morning and said first that they couldnt open the account with {$500.00} only {$300.00} since that was the line of credit originally. Later in this same phone call she said they werent willing to open the credit line with {$500.00}. It seems like they arent really trying to correct their mistake and dont want to do what seems appropriate to make the situation right.\\nOk so I deposited my work check of a total of XXXX , and I dont know exactly where that money went at all I wanted to know where all of that money went that I deposited into my account. When I try to cash my check again it isnt letting me at all. I needed them to reverse the payment on my check because my check says its been cashed already.\\n\"Hi, I was using Chase Sapphire Preferred card, I have booked a flight ticket of XXXX XXXX for {$4000.00} from their own travel website, for some reason on the date of flying the passengers were not able to take the flight. \\nThe Flight company asked to reach out to the vendor ( Chase travels ) to cancel or reschedule the flight since I used their service to book the flight. \\nIt was around 4 hours before the flight, I tried calling the chase travel whole night but no one picked up the call and meanwhile the flight took off. \\nNext day Chase travel said that since the flight is gone we can not refund anything. I asked them that\\'s it\\'s your mistake since no one took my call when I tried for whole night for at least 4-5 hours. \\nThey said, since we can not cancel the ticket after 24 hours of booking, but I asked them that at least someone should have taken my grievance that time, and I was asking for re-schedule also for at least the return flight cost rather than the whole flight. But since no one picked up the call whole night they are putting this cost to my account and forcing me to pay. \\nNeed help in such case. \\nRegards XXXX\"\\nHad a negative balance on card, they couldn\\'t tell the difference between and negative or positive balance they charged me {$25.00} overdraft twice even though nothing was owed. They refunded half of the charges but still another {$25.00} was charged. They never correct it.\\n\"In XX/XX/XXXX I purchased a vacation for my XXXX birthday for my mom, sister and myself. I charged my mom and sister \\'s vacation on a XXXX card. I purchased my vacation on the Citibank card. I booked the vacation through Cheap XXXX. When we arrived to our vacation spot the hotel recommended by XXXX XXXX was an all-inclusive resort which was supposed to include the following but not limited to, non-motorized water sports, daily activities, nightly live shows and entertainment. \\nThe first evening our room did not have electricity for two nights and the \"\" all-inclusive \\'\\' resort did not have the amenities that it was claimed to provide. I attempted to work with the merchant and the hotel and their recommendations were not acceptable to me. \\n\\nUpon my return from the vacation, I disputed the charges with XXXX and Citibank. XXXX was able to recover the disputed amounts and Citibank responded on the last week of XX/XX/XXXX that they were not able to recover the disputed charge of approximately {$360.00}. \\n\\nI had called Citibank to discuss their decision and after speaking with a variety of associates at Citibank they told me that I did not accept the merchant \\'s suggestion to move to another resort. XXXX XXXX of Citibank told me her position was with the Executive Response Unit of the President of Citibank. She actually insinuated that I should have moved to another resort. Ultimately, the associates of Citibank should not discuss what options I should have taken and Citibank should have handled recovering the disputed amount with the merchant because what was offered was not provided and their recommendation to move to another resort one day prior to my departure was not an acceptable solution for me and my family.\"\\nTwo years ago I called to close my Capital one Account. XXXX Instead they offered to upgrade the account with the promise I would pay no more yearly fees. I took them at their word. Last year, in XX/XX/XXXX -- fee. I called, and shared this story and they refunded the fee. This year -- fee. I would like to have spoken to someone about this but their automated system would not let me so I chose to close the account. Supposedly they will automatically refund the annual fee, but I suspect I will not get back the late fee on the fee and the minimum interest charge on the fee. But the important part here is that you need to know that Capital one reps will tell you they are getting you into a program with no fees and then ... fees.\\n\"Date/Time of event : Tuesday, XX/XX/2019. Approx. XXXX XXXX Tried to access my credit card account with JPMorganChase online. Site responded that it did not recognize the computer I was using and needed to send a temporary code to validate the computer ( same computer I\\'ve been using to access site for almost 5 years ). \\n\\nWent though the notification routine multiple times first trying to initiate an email to my email address multiple times -- no email with temporary code ever received. Then went to telephone option to initiate call with temporary code. No callback with code ever received. \\n\\nTried this numerous times with same result -- nothing. Clearly a problem with the system that generates and/or sends the codes to customers in this situation. \\n\\nCalled customer service who indicated they could send me a text message with the temporary code. I told them I only have a landline and not a cellphone to receive a text message so they would have to send me the code someone other way -- like email -- or by sharing code with me on the phone ( the very landline and presumably they have caller ID to validate I was calling from the same number ). They said they could not do this, but that I could go to a JPMC branch ( many, many miles away and I only have an online credit card account with JPMC ). \\n\\nTo all this I replied that they were making their system problems my problem and were preventing me from accessing my account. I indicated this would be against the terms of the account and that I wanted to speak with their General Counsel \\'s office, to which they replied they could not provide a bank attorney to speak to but I could always contact my own attorney. I reconfirmed that we were being recorded so the tape could be pulled if necessary, then told them I would report it to CFPB instead and that they had extremely poor customer service. I suggested that if their CEO XXXX XXXX knew the facts of the situation and how their customer service responded so illogically to a customer, he would not be happy and invited them to share the tape with him ( expletives and all ) As of XXXX XXXX ET, I still do not have online access to my credit card account at JPMC.',\n",
              " \"On XX/XX/2019, I was informed by Discover that my credit card had possibly been used fraudulently. Upon checking my account I noticed five charges that had been made on my card by a scammer in XXXX XXXX, Florida. I live in Georgia and have never been to XXXX XXXX. Discover realized the mistake and credited the Florida charges. My account was closed and a new card was to be issued that I should receive in 5-7 days. Discover also added additional security questions to my  account including a verbal password stating these additional features should protect me. I also put a security freeze and fraud alert on my credit report. \\n\\nAfter 15 days, I contacted Discover to inform them that I never received a new card. A Discover representative said the new card had been sent but it had not been activated. When she confirmed my address, she used the XXXX XXXX location!!! The scammer was able to get a new Discover card in my name sent to her Florida address. How is this happening? \\n\\nAgain, I attempted to correct the address debacle. Discover closed that account and sent me a new card via XXXX XXXX to my address in Georgia. I received the card the next day. As of today ( XX/XX/2019 ), no new charges have been made to my credit card account. \\n\\nThe compliant is that prior to XX/XX/XXXX and since that time the scammer has been able to change my mother 's maiden name and change the verbal password created to protect me. How does a maiden name change? Shouldn't that create alarm? The scammer knows my name, social security number, and birthday. I welcome the third degree I now get when I call and I continue to request additional security on my account as the scammer seems to know everything typically used and Discover falls for it. Additional protection has been provided ; however, I continue to get emails and phone calls from Discover to verify that I want to change my email or home address, etc. \\n\\nRelated to this is that I've had fraudulent activity on my Discover Bank account as well ( {$4000.00} ). Previously, I didn't realize that Discover Bank and Discover Card are two different entities and require their own security options. When I thought I was safe with Discover credit card I find out later that Discover Bank doesn't have the new information and visa-versa. The scammer had access to both. \\n\\nEven with the new security measures Discover has taken, I can never trust the Discover credit card or Discover bank again. \\n\\nThank you PS : My VISA account was also compromised. One conversation resolved the matter. The account was closed and a new card was issued within days. Thank you XXXX XXXX.\",\n",
              " 'To Whom It May Concern : I am writing you to attempt to get assistance for my Chase Sapphire card, which ends in XXXX. I first reported this issue in XXXX, XXXX. \\nMy job requires travel and, in XXXX, sent me to XXXX XXXX, XXXX. Ive always liked to work out so I set out to find a gym. The only gym in town was XXXX XXXX so I signed on and added tanning to my membership, which was about {$59.00} a month. This was around XXXX XXXX of XXXX. That was the ONLY time I ever saw the owner of that gym. \\nIn XXXX of XXXX the tanning machine at that location was broken. In XXXX of XXXX, I started trying to get the tanning membership removed from my account, as I was still being charged for a BROKEN item that could not be used. I both emailed and called the gym. Neither have been replied to, TO THIS DAY. During this time I continued to go to work out at the gym, so I also left a note slid under the door of his office about wanting to cancel the tanning portion of my membership. Nothing was done so I got online and requested my money back for tanning on my membership at that time, you could report unauthorized use of your card online. They did the usual follow upsending letters confirming my request, etc. Somewhere around XXXX, XXXX, I opened up my credit card bill and found that XXXX had charged me {$260.00} dollars ( not positive on that amount but its close ) for no reason at all. I called Chase immediately and told them to block this merchant from my card. At this time, the representative that I spoke with at Chase confirmed that the owner of XXXX XXXX wasnt answering their calls/letters either. I also, AGAIN, sent email and a phone call to the gym to cancel. As I had requested that Chase block the merchant from my card, I had no reason to suspect that I would be charged again. I trusted them to do the right thing for me, their customer. \\nXXXX was a busy time for me. Im in the XXXX  and XXXX business as a XXXX and in XXXX, my entire XXXX  was laid off. Id made the decision to move to XXXX permanently so I was in between XXXX and XXXX  a lot, plus starting a new, very demanding job. Id put my credit card in my jewelry box and set it on autopay because I wasnt always getting my mail in a timely manner. I admittedly didnt open a statement for several months because I was just buried. That was my fault. \\nIn late XXXX or early XXXX of XXXX, I opened my statement and found a {$59.00} charge from XXXX XXXX. I went back several statements and found out that the payments to them NEVER STOPPED. I got online immediately and discovered that, for some strange reason, I was not able to dispute charges online any longer. So I got up from my desk ( after my move, I took a real job in an XXXX, no longer a XXXX ), signed out for my 15 minute break and sat, on hold, for well over ten minutes. I told the customer service representative what was going on and they said theyd look into it. \\nTheir idea of looking into it involved taking zero responsibility and offering zero help to me, their customer. I have several letters attached to this showing their response. The most recent letter is attached as well, which is the one I will be addressing here. In that letter, Chase states that they will not be helping me on this. They state that the XXXX XXXX charge were too old to do anything about. I disagree with that as it should have been addressed in XXXX of XXXX but as I stated above, I should have caught it. The kicker is their response to the XXXX XXXX charges. They state that they never received my reply when they sent letter for more information. These letters that they sent were dated the last week of XXXX and had to be returned by XX/XX/XXXX. They state they never received my reply, which is a BLATANT lie. Not only did I mail them ( due to the date I received them, they would not arrive to Chase by XX/XX/XXXX. Pretty sure they knew this when they mailed them. ) but I also submitted them online, as the letter stated I could do. You will see the PDFs of emails that I received stating that Chase had received my online message, and the date on those emails is prior to XX/XX/XXXX. They stated that due to my inaction in returning the letter that they would not help me any longer which again, was simply untrue, as proven by my emails that are attached. It was also mailed to them. \\nIn the meantime, due to Chases incompetence, I also submitted a XXXX XXXX XXXX complaint. This compliant is still outstanding. Someone named XXXX who claimed to be from Chases corporate office called and left me a voice mail. I called her back within five minutes and have yet to receive a return call. Ive not received a single phone call from anyone at Chase who wants to help me, in fact they seem to be actively avoiding me. I understand that COVID 19 has them very busy but this started in XXXX. \\nI want my charges from XXXX to XXXX refunded. I jumped through every single hoop that Chase requested to get this done. This was NOT a valid charge and I stated this in XX/XX/XXXX. If they are not going to over any protection to me, their customer, then I want all three of my Chase accounts closed. I do not want to continue to do business with someone who does not protect me as a customer. \\nIve attached several letters from customer service ( ha! ). You can tell by the letters that they do not care about their customers at all. \\nMy telephone number is XXXX. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions at all. \\n\\nBest Regards, XXXX XXXX XXXX']"
