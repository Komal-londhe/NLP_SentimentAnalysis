The matter regarding credit for {$5000.00} for a charge made to XXXX B. The matter regarding credit for {$2800.00} for a charge made to XXXX a. The result of your review is based on your misunderstanding of the timeline and coincidence of the amount and reason ( s ) for disputes. \\nRecognize there were XXXX separate charges for {$5000.00} in close to one another. The first was to XXXX ; transaction XXXX and the other to someone from XXXX XXXX, XXXX, NV : transaction XXXX. \\nI called in a dispute in XXXX. 2016 for the transaction XXXX in the amount of {$5000.00} by someone in XXXX NV. I did not make this charge. As you can see by the foreign fees I was in XXXX. Yes when noticed this charge I immediately called it in. The card ending in XXXX was cancelled by your fraud department and I was given a new number ending in XXXX. This was handled as it should have been and thank you for the great service at that time. \\nNow fast forward to present time. I am now disputing the transaction XXXX, a charge I did make at that time in the amount of {$5000.00} to XXXX. XXXX has been shut down for fraud by the government and has gravely impacted its members due non-access to products and services and the internet marketing system. \\nb. The charge for {$2800.00}, transaction XXXX to XXXX  was mentioned in the initial case submitted through CFPB. This is a charge that also represents the payment made to this failed company. The refund in the total of {$7800.00} is requested. XXXX + XXXX = XXXX. If I have to or there is a need to file a separate claim for this charge based on the same reason : FRAUD, then I will do so. Please advise. \\n\\nMy response is in direct response to XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX  received by mail.', 'I was on a business trip in XXXX, my co workers and I want to a bar/restraint. I tried to pay for the bill with my credit card but it was declined because I needed to enter in a PIN. I had no idea that my card had a PIN so I was not able to enter it. My coworker then end up paying for the bill. When I received my last credit card bill the card from the bar/restaurant in XXXX was on the bill. I called my credit card company to dispute this and they rejected my claim. \\n\\nI was told at the bar/restaurant that my card was declined and that it would not be charged. The credit card company told me to work it out with the bar/restaurant. This happened in XXXX, the people at the bar/restaurant barley knew how to speak English, and I do not even remember the name of the restaurant.\\n\\nIn good faith and to keep my credit score in tack I have since paid for this expense.', 'I applied for the Chase Freedom Account online and I was approved.

I called several time each time connected overseas and no one knew why I could not activate my new card and told me to call back. I kept calling back. I still have no idea what is happening or why I can not activate the new card. One of the reps said something about the account being closed, but could not say why.\\n\\nI am elderly and can\\'t understand what these people are saying on the phone.

I was told each I could redeem towards travel however I was never told the travel had to be purchased through Chase.

I spent {$4000.00} and cant redeem my points earned towards my travel purchase.\\n\"For some odd reason XXXX believes my card was fraudulently opened. Once I got that straightened out they turned it back on and I was able to use it for a day. Then all the sudden it has been reported as \"\" lost \\'\\' according to them. To which I have to call the fraud department to get it fixed. This is an ongoing problem that needs fixed, and resolved! I have not reported it stolen, I have it in my custody, I am looking at it as I type this complaint.

To date the {$2300.00} payment has not been applied to my account. I checked my statement online on XX/XX/XXXX and noticed the issue. I used the online messaging system to alert XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to the issue. I never received a reply to that message and any trace of that initial contact has been removed from my online account records. I called on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, and spoke to a customer service representative. She requested that I fax confirmation of payment so that the Payment Research Department could investigate the issue. I sent the fax to the number I was given, ( XXXX ) XXXX at XXXX XXXX CST on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX. The fax machine report indicated that the fax was transmitted successfully. I have placed calls to customer service on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. I have talked to three different customer service reps and one supervisor.

Assuming this was just a card that accumulated points for purchases in store, I agreed. \\n\\nHowever, when the cashier began to ask me for my social security number, drivers license, etc. I asked why she needed that information. She replied it was necessary for the store rewards card. As I believed this to only be a store card I provided the requested information. \\n\\nAt no point in this process did the cashier indicate in any way that this was a credit card application. If she had I would have immediately declined as I had no desire for another credit card. When she informed me that I had been approved I was flabbergasted and asked why she had not told me this was a credit card. Her response was that she had told me it was a store rewards card. \\n\\nAs this was a Saturday ; I contacted the creditor, Synchrony Bank, on Monday, XX/XX/2019 to have them cancel this card and asked them to remove this inquiry from my credit report. The representative was helpful and cancelled the card and told me he would forward my request to have the inquiry removed. I emphatically told him that I was intentionally misled and not informed that this was a credit card application. He indicated he would provide that information. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/2019 I received a response from Synchrony Bank, copy attached, in which they informed me that as I had provided the necessary information for their paperless credit card application they were not able to remove this credit inquiry. They went on to inform me that compliance is very important to them and they follow all applicable laws as outlined in the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). If that is so, then their employees should disclose to customers that they are applying for a CREDIT CARD and not a STORE REWARDS CARD. \\n\\nAdditionally, they state in their letter to me that it was fully disclosed to me on the application that Synchrony Bank would access my credit file when processing my application. However, as this was a paperless application as they stated, how would I have known that? They clearly have contradicted themselves in this instance. \\n\\nAs I was misled ; whether intentional or not ; this practice clearly is in violation of the FCRA in which a consumer needs to be fully informed of what they are applying for. Im sure I am not the only consumer that may have been impacted by this practice ; not only at this store. This may be their store practice to encourage their employees with incentives on accounts opened. \\n\\nI respectfully ask that this inquiry be removed from my credit report immediately.', \"1. Citibank is attempting to collect on a debt, under my name, that they have yet to validate. I have called numerous times, yet they are unable to provide me answers. \\nI want to see validation. I am reporting the account as a fraud account that I personally never applied for, also I have police affidavit and other id theft reports. \\n2. Why does Citibank deny me 0 % liability for unauthorized transactions and fail to report my disputed transactions to CRA 's. One example, XX/XX/2017, {$560.00} to XXXX XXXX, unauthorized. \\nI called and reported the charge in XX/XX/2017. Citibank issued me a new card and number, but continues to deny me of my rights to dispute the charge. \\n3. I found out, independently that one XXXX XXXX applied for a Citibank Checking Account using my social security number. \\nWhy did Citibank not notify me, despite my name and XXXX XXXX showing up after entering my XXXX in Citibank 's computer system? Why was I never notified, until I addressed it to Citibank President Office? Years after the incident?\", \"To my knowledge, I was never late on my Capital One credit card with account number XXXX. But I realized that I was reported as being 30 days past due in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX and as being 60 days past due in XX/XX/XXXX which is not true. I have had this credit card since XX/XX/XXXX with no late payments and not sure why all of a sudden I was reported late. To my knowledge I have always have 100 % positive payment history and have not only tried to pay way before my due date, but also have tried to pay more than the minimum amount. Like even now my balance is low because I make sure to maintain my credit properly. \\n\\nBut you can see that XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX are all reporting a different balance which goes to show that something isn't right.\", 'On XX/XX/2019 I applied for the paypal rewards mastercard issued by Synchrony bank. They did a hard pull on my XXXX credit report. I received a message stating to call them which I did. The customer service representative only asked me my phone number and then told me I had to wait 7-10 days ( which was fine ). On XX/XX/XXXX, I received another email from them stating I was declined because they could not verify my identity. They did not mention any usage of my XXXX credit report, nor did they do their due diligence of asking me to submit ID verification documents like any other financial institute would do. I sitll have not received the hard letter copy. After reviewing my credit reports, I updated my address and phone number and applied for another synchrony credit card ( WALMART ). Again, same message to call. Again, only asked for phone number. After googling I found out they use your phone number to verify your identity so good luck if you have a new number like me. \\nI want them to either remove the hard inquiries from my credit report or let me send in sufficient documentation to verify my identity.', 'On XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed a charge that I was not familiar with so I immediately call bluebird American Express at XXXX. A male IVR picked up and said they are expecting higher than normal call volume or they can not answer right now, and it disconnects after 5 seconds. I thought that was very strange and unacceptable. So once I got off from work, I kept calling and a woman IVR picks up also and NEVER EVER gives me the option to speak with a live representative. Between XXXX and XXXX I made six call attempts until I gave up and said Ill just call back tomorrow. My last call was this morning, XX/XX/XXXX : same result. \\n\\nI have made over 25 phone call attempts in 7 days. I have even dialed the international number to no avail, and reached out to Bluebird Amex on XXXX, and they advised me to call the same non-working number XXXX.

Prior to enrolling in the program, i contacted all of my creditors to try and change my payment due dates and all agreed accept Citi. I then received the above mentioned notice and the letter is very threatening, advising that they will deny participation in the program if late payment continues and require full payment of the entire balance due. I contacted the number on the letter and spent over an hour trying to accomplish what the letter asked me to do. My requests to change the due date with a live representative were repeatedly denied, and each time the representative explained they were not the correct department. At the 4th representative named XXXX, ID number XXXX, I asked her to document the file that I have called this morning, spoken to 4 different people who denied my request to change the due date and each transferred me. I asked her to repeat the notes she entered into the file and she just put me on hold which I am currently on while typing out this complaint. While typing this complaint a new representative named XXXX answered the call and I went through the story for the 5th time and he yet again told me he wasn\\'t the correct department and had to transfer me. At this stage, I decided I could no longer waste my time trying to do the right thing.\\n\"I am a Capital One credit card holder but also a retailer that accepts credit cards as payment for products and services. This qualifies more as a rant than a problem seeking resolution. After completing a purchase on XXXX yesterday using my Capital One Visa, I  subsequently received an email from Capital One : Hi, we saw you just spent {$220.00} on XXXX. Did you get the best deal on XXXX? \\nThe email then proceeded to pitch a competitive travel booking product called XXXX, associated with Capital One. \\n\\nIf Capital One reached out to my customers after a card they issued was used to purchase my products and tried to steal my business I would find that unethical. Perhaps XXXX and similar vendors would like to know about these practices.', 'My business was recently lost in a major flooding event in XXXX County,  CA on XX/XX/XXXX. It was declared a state of emergency by Governor XXXX, and is being assessed as a natural disaster by FEMA. Since it has not yet been assessed as so and might not considering the rural nature, Citibank Visa XXXX Card will not recognize what I am going through as such. That being said, I have been reaching out to them since XX/XX/XXXX to try and get a late charge reversed but since I had one reversed back in XX/XX/XXXX and their \"\" company policy \\'\\' won\\'t allow that, they will not help me. I\\'ve escalated the call and asked to speak with a supervisor who called me back 2 days later and I was again unsatisfied by their unfair treatment of my situation, as I explained I have no income and would like to work out a payment program, but feel it would only be fair to remove the late fee. Once again, I was escalated to their supervisor who was supposed to call me within 2 more days and never received a call. So, I tried calling from the bottom of the totem pole again today XX/XX/XXXX as I am doing my best to resolve this situation and another late fee has accrued since they\\'ve not been responsive. Much to my disappointment I waited on hold for nearly 20 minutes before they told me nobody was available and someone would call me back in 2 days. I am not sure what else to do. I\\'ve explained my situation ... I have NO income and wish to make some kind of arrangement with reasonable monthly payments, but they aren\\'t willing to work with me and keep dragging it out so that I have even more late fees that they refuse to reverse.

I have talked to over 7 different representatives who claimed they would fix this, which was never resolved. The company sends emails and texts saying that it will allow you to link the card to your XXXX account, however after 6 months of research I discovered that XXXX actually has NO association with this card or bank, and the card can not be added. Each time I made a complaint they resend the same text messages and emails which provided ZERO results. I have been lied to, lead on, and am having to pay a credit card bill which I have NOT ONCE seen an actual bill for. I had ordered a product many months ago which I never received, I was unable to provide a receipt for this purchase due to the fraudulent company and therefore had to forfeit the product which I paid for. This is absolutely ridiculous and after nearly a year I don\\'t know where else to turn.\\n\"I have a Capital One account, and had a balance transfer promotion on the account per a bathroom remodel. My line of credit on the card is $ XXXX, and the balance as of XX/XX/XXXX was {$8500.00}. I have since paid {$8100.00}. \\n\\nMy issue is as follows : I moved in to temporary housing in XX/XX/XXXX and requested a change of address. The address was not changed and as a result I did not receive statements until the XXXX statement was forwarded by the post office. The account has been on auto pay since the commencement of the balance transfer promotion, which included a balance transfer fee. Capital One was receiving payments all along. I since called Cap One due to the forwarding label and old address reflected on the statement and they confirmed the address had not been changed as requested, but they would proceed to make the update. \\n\\nThe address change issue led to my account being charged interest I believe for the months of XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX due to the balance transfer offer having expired. I had no other transactions other than the promo. I called the customer service department twice speaking with XXXX and XXXX ( ID XXXX ). Both acknowledged the address issues and non receipt of statements being very apologetic. Yet, they indicated Cap One does not adjust interest charged. They totally refused to escalate the call indicating they are sr. representatives and that is where it stops because they do not have the ability to transfer calls to their own supervisor or to escalate matters further. \\n\\nI called the executive office as I feel I have been treated unfairly and discriminated against and they advised me that all escalations have to go through their general customer service department. This is a large bank and it is unfathmable that this is the way they operate their business and treat customers. I am requesting that the interest charged of {$350.00} be adjusted. Credit card companies are required to provide monthly billing statements to customers, and the fact that Cap One did not do this and conveniently the Balance Transfer promo was to expire makes me believe that it was intentional. I am disputing the interest charged and am requesting an immediate refund for the amount. This will bring my account balance to XXXX. \\n\\nI hope that you can assist me with this matter. \\n\\nShould you have any questions, I can be reached at ( XXXX XXXX XXXX. My new address is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX DE XXXX. But, the new mailing address is XXXX.

I received a notice from a Collection Agency that they are handling this account. Citibank is reporting Inaccurate information, if the account has been transferred or sold to a third party for collection, it should not be reporting a balance or a past due amount. Under the FCRA guideline this is a clear Violation. I would like to have this Inaccurate information deleted from all three of my credit files. This is impacting my ability to obtain credit due to the incorrect reporting by Citibank. I have contacted Citibank concerning this issue before and it was never corrected.\\nIn XX/XX/2019 I received a phone call from XXXX XXXX stating she is going to handle my case from XXXX XXXX. She told me that and hung up. I didnt ask her anything or go into depth about anything. I received a letter today dated XX/XX/XXXX thanking me for speaking with her and that I requested for my card to be reopened. Neither are true and she lied about a letter being sent to me. XXXX wrote a letter that was basically a lie. She called to inform me she was taking the case and hung up! Nothing else was said or asked.\\n\"I have a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX store card.

The application of a payment towards the current statement ammount to the current balance and future statement, is a violation of the terms of the XXXX XXXX XXXX credit agreement. As a result {$27.00} remained on the \"\" Special Event \\'\\' balance on my XX/XX/XXXX statement along with a debit for the entire interest that would have accrued on the \"\" Special Event \\'\\' financing.

In the 11 month run up to the final payment being due, XXXX XXXX XXXX never miss-allocated a payment. All of my payments went towards the balance of the current statement. Only on the last month did XXXX XXXX XXXX try to confuse me by miss-applying a payment to a future billing cycle. I worry that other consumers would fall prey to this con.

The reason I filed the dispute is I returned everything in store face to face but XXXX didn\\'t refund me. And I kept the return receipt as the supporting document. Chase got response from XXXX saying they never got my return so Chase asked me to provide the return receipt. This is all acceptable and understandable. I did send the return receipt to the email Chase provided right after they called me. But then they called me saying they still haven\\'t received anything from me. We confirmed the email address again and I told them I would send the email again which I did right away. I also told them to call me back if they still couldn\\'t get it which they didn\\'t. Instead I got a letter from Chase on XX/XX/2019 asking me to provide the document again. I was trying to upload the document through the secure messages but I couldn\\'t due to their website technical problems.Then I emailed again and called the dispute customer service again asking about this. They asked me to fax it. I faxed two times in the morning on XX/XX/2019. Then I also called them to confirm if they receive it or not. Shockingly, they still told me they haven\\'t received anything. On XX/XX/2019, I called Chase dispute service twice. First time the lady told me they still didn\\'t see anything from me but second time another lady told me they got my fax. However, on XX/XX/2019, this guy from Chase called me again telling me they are still waiting for me to provide the document and told me they haven\\'t got anything from me. I am so upset and frustrated with all this inefficient communications. I am the one being cooperative and keep calling them and sending them the documents so many times. But instead of checking through its own process, Chase only knows to call me and keep asking me for the documents that I already provided by fax or email. This is really painful to me and really unacceptable.\\n\"Step 1 : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX  XXXX I was making a purchase of airline ticket and the card transaction is blocked. \\nStep 2 : XXXX XXXX XXXX Logged in to mobile app, saw alert and contacted Citicards no on the alert through mobile ph Step 3 : XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX As I got an office work, I have my wife ( joint ac holder ) speak to customer service.

I have concerns. \\n\\n1. The CFPB states on their website : \"\" Credit card companies must establish procedures to assure that their bills are mailed or delivered to you at least 21 days before the payment is due. \\'\\' Chase now states : \"\" Your due date will be a minimum of 21 days after the close of each billing cycle \\'\\' Chase can not get their statements sent out until the billing cycle ends ; therefore, anyone receiving their statement by mail will have the time to pay their bill decreased to less than the 21 days. While I realize many people do their payments online, this change, of course, hits all the people with no computers the hardest, the people who can least afford any late fees. ( I assume that is the intention of Chase -- to make more money off those least able. ) 2. Binding Arbitration : Chase is now forcing all clients into binding Arbitration. There is a very complicated way to write to them at a specific place by a specific time including very specific information. I intend to do that, but I noticed that they kept delaying where that information was placed in the brochure, mentioning it twice, but it did not actually show up until a page later. ( Later Chase states that it will be paying all the arbitration fees -- really, whose pocket will the arbitrator be in? ) They also state that if you do not decline this, you can not be part of a class action suit. \\n\\nI realize that Donald Trump nixed the whole binding arbitration legislation that was to go into effect to protect consumers.

I took care of the bill ( including late fees, which brought the bill to three times what I spent on the credit card ) during the same call and thought everything was okay. I checked my credit report and found that Macy \\'s and/or their servicer, Citibank, reported me to the credit bureaus. I called Macy \\'s back and asked again where they sent me the bills. They told me that they sent me the bills electronically to my email address as I had agreed to receive electronic bill. I never agreed to receive electronic bills to my email address. I checked my email account and I did not receive any bills from Macy \\'s. They also said they called me about the bill. When I asked them what phone number they called they said they called XXXX, which is a landline where I used to live in XXXX more than 9 years ago.

The only reason I wasn\\'t on time with Macy \\'s bill is because I did not know of the bill.\\nI closed this credit card account months ago.

They told us once we reviewed the material and if we were not satisfied we could cancel at any time. It was a lot of material they gave us and we did not get around reviewing everything until sometime in XXXX / XXXX of 2020. When we reviewed the material we found out that the time share did not work the way it was explained and we were not happy about it. We tried cancelling and they told us it was too late to cancel. They lied to us. Also we found out the whole transaction was based on bad information we were told that the transaction would not go thru if one of us wasnt working and at the time my husband was unemployed and they still put the transaction thru. We were stuck with the credit card bill and with the time share also. we reached out to the credit card and made a dispute but they responded that we were liable for the charges. We have not been able to use the time share and the credit card transaction was for part of the time share.

Before I placed the order, I checked my XXXX Chase credit card limit, and I only had {$180.00} left, so I wasn't going to order until I could deposit some money and pay down my bill, but on the checkout page, there was an option to break the total amount into 18 equal payment of $ XXXX per month. So I checked the box and placed the order, expecting to see a charge of the first month 's amount. Instead, I was billed the full amount on my XXXX Chase credit card, which removed the last of my remaining credit, and caused me to exceed my credit limit. No doubt, I would have had penalties, but as soon as I saw the charge notification, I called Chase, who tranferred me to XXXX, and I cancelled the order. Chase then assured me that everything was corrected, and was back to the way it was previosly. ( We'll see ) When talking to the Chase person, she said that while they offered 18 months split up into equal, interest free payments, it actually was implemented as 18 months of an interest free loan - which is not the same thing at all. In fact, the person I was talking to at Chase said that she very recently took advantage of the same offer, only to find out that she too was billed for the full amount, to her surprise. \\nBeing able to pay in 18 installments is not the same as being charged the full amount interest free for 18 months. And how would that work? How would they separate this charge, at zero percent interest rate, from other charges? No doubt, they would find a way to profit from the 'no interest ' loan. \\nThey could have easily called it an 18 month interest free loan, but chose to make a misleading statement.\", 'I want to complaint regarding chase bank customer service.

Around XX/XX/XXXX I contacted chase and asked a status of my application and chase representative notified that I have to fill and send them back by mail the social security verification form. In two days I received this form but I feel uncomfortable to send my ss by mail and I called chase and they told me that I could fax this from chase bank brunch. I came to west side Chase Bank and brunch manager reviewed form and faxed the form to verification department. I waited for another week and then called to chase to verify status of my application and representative said that my application was denied I asked why I have an excellent credit history and high credit score.  Representative said that I should receive letter from chase soon I asked contact me with supervisor. First supervisor said that my application was denied and after I started to argue and said it is impossible to be denied with my credit history she transfer me to another department and representative said that application wasnt denied but they couldnt finish verification because social security verification form wasnt filled incorrectly instead of credit card box mortgage box was checked. I asked him to correct the box but he refused and asked me to send a new form. I went back to bank and tell XXXX brunch manager about problem with social security verification form and he helped me to complete the form again and faxed it.

I called XXXX to determine why they had sent me these bars. They stated that an order had been placed in my name, and using my credit card. I immediately called my credit card company and told them of this fraudulent card. They said they would open a fraud investigation and reverse the charge. They then closed my credit card and sent a new card. \\n\\nI called back XXXX and asked them if they wanted me to ship there bars back, thinking that they were also somehow a victim in this fraudulent charge, and they should get their bars back since the credit card company was reversing the charge. \\n\\nThey emailed a shipping label, and I returned the energy bars to them. \\n\\nInXX/XX/XXXX, without any notification or attempt to contact me or determine if I really did receive the shipment or if I'd returned it, Citi Bank revered the {$570.00} credit to my card. Upon calling Citi after seeing this charge on my card, their rep stated that their fraud department had determined that I had received a shipment, and was therefore responsible for the charge. They demanded that I show proof that I returned the bars, and that they would investigate my claim to determine whether they would reverse the charge again. I stated that I did not place the order, and that had never contacted me about whether I had the product. They were very clear that the only determination as to whether I should be charged was whether I had received a shipment. After speaking with a rude customer service agent who could only tell me there was nothing she or I could do other than provide proof that the energy bars were shipped back, I asked to speak with a supervisor. The supervisor I spoke with was condescending, using a mocking tone of voice and seemed to take pleasure telling me that I had to provide proof or there was no recourse. \\n\\nThis complaint is against both Citi Bank and XXXX. Citi Bank enables fraudulent companies to charge unwitting consumers large amounts by forcing the burden of proof on the victim. I have absolutely no recourse to recover this large amount of money without proof that I no longer have something that I did not want. Regardless of whether I had kept these bars, shipped them back, or threw them away, there was never any communication by Citi on their requirements as to what I needed to do so that I would not be charged. \\n\\nXXXX disputed the reversal and provided proof to Citi that they shipped these bars, even though I had sent them back. I believe this clearly shows that they are actively defrauding consumers by shipping these outrageously overpriced bars to stolen credit cards so that they can charge everyone who is not savvy enough to ship the bars back and keep the shipping information.\", 'My original credit limit was {$10000.00}.

While I use the store card side of it regularly, I very seldom use the American Express side. \\n\\nWhen you go the account information feature, there is no balance information on the page. One needs to click to access that information. I have always found that unusual, as all my other accounts have the balance on the main page. \\n\\nWhen I clicked, I saw that there was a balance of {$250.00} on the American Express side. Again, because I seldom use it, I had no recollection of making a purchase, so I called XXXX XXXX thinking it was a fraudulent transaction. This was after I had attempted to see the original charge, which I could not access. I was able to access recent late fees charges in the amounts of {$38.00} each ( there were four ). \\n\\nWhen I reached Customer Service on XX/XX/XXXX, I explained the situation and was told that I had had a transaction in XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX. I immediately remembered that I had purchased some concert tickets in a pre-sale, so that indeed was my transaction. She said that my account was past due and gave me an amount, which I quickly paid that same day ( {$150.00} : I paid the remaining {$98.00} on XX/XX/XXXX ). The customer service rep also said that, as a courtesy, she would remove two late charge fees. \\n\\nI proceeded to ask her why I had not gotten any notifications from them about these past due charges. She said that statements had been mailed to me. I swear to you that I did not receive any statements. ( In XXXX XXXX defense, however, I have someone in my neighborhood who has the same house number, but lives on a different street, and I very often get his mail delivered to my house, so this may have occurred. ) I also never got a phone call, e-mail, or any other type of correspondence about my account being past due. Yet, I almost get daily e-mails from XXXXXXXX XXXX with special offers. \\n\\nWhile I know that the store can not babysit me, and I am responsible for making my payments on time, this was an oversight that I could have instantly remedied by getting a reminder. I wonder if this is a tactic used to charge people late fees. Also, I have always questioned why the balance on one 's account does not immediately pop up on the XXXXXXXX XXXX website as it does in others. \\n\\nNeedless to say, I checked my FICO score and it had dropped 93 points ( from an XXXX ). \\n\\nIn 26 years I have not had a late payment. I would not risk ruining my credit score for such a small amount. \\n\\nCoincidentally, within two days, I received a statement saying my account was late, as well as a notification that they had been trying to reach me by phone. They were mailed to me before my call to XXXX XXXX, but about 120 days after my original transaction. \\n\\nI want to know why, and I want my original credit score reinstated. \\n\\nThank you for listening, and for your attention to this matter.\", \"My Amazon store credit card handled by Synchrony bank, is telling me I am late with a my payment that is due on XX/XX/2019.

As I was making the reservation on the website a $XXXX discount promotion was offered if I opened up a Barclay\\'s Wyndham Visa Credit Card. The webpage even showed the subtracting the $XXXX from my total for the reservation: $XXXX- $XXXX= $XXXX. So I jumped on it and was approved. When I received the approval email came later that XXXX XXXX  day, nothing was mentioned about the $XXXX promotion or any promotion for that matter. Right after I checked out using the Barclay\\'s Wyndham credit card, I contacted Barclay\\'s to inquire about the $XXXX promotional discount. The woman at first said it was only a $XXXX credit promotion then she looked on the XXXX XXXX  website and said, \"\"I found it.\"\" Just as I said, \"\"Ok great\"\" she put me on hold for quite a few minutes. Then she came back on and said it was now \"\"only for $XXXX.\"\" I told her that was unacceptable. Fortunately, the call was recorded on her end. I received a generic letter from Barclay\\'s on XX/XX/2019 that did not even address the issue and said if I have any concerns to contact Barclay\\'s. On my first statement, I was only given a $XXXX credit.  I called two more times to complain about not getting the $XXXX promotional discount and the customer service is in the XXXX. I don\\'t appreciate the \"\"bait and switch\"\" tactics. I never heard of nor read or saw a $XXXX promotion. Every time I call Barclay\\'s they want \"\"proof\"\" of the $XXXX discount promotion but they don\\'t provide proof of the $XXXX promo in their email to me or their website. Knowing what I know now I should have taken a photo of the screen when I applied for the Barclay\\'s Wyndham credit card. I would have never applied for another credit card for just a $XXXX promo. I have three major credit cards and several store credit cards. I don\\'t need more credit cards.  I just took out a consolidation loan to pay off my credit card debt. I maintain Barclay\\'s pulled a \"\"bait and switch\"\" promotion. They should be held accountable and fined accordingly and I should get the full $XXXX off.', 'This is the second time I am having issue with XXXX XXXX card. Last time case # XXXX. \\n\\nThe last time I made the purchase using this store card was in the month of XX/XX/XXXX. Post making the purchase, I asked customer agent to let me know how much is the total balance and as suggested by the agent I made the final payment thinking my account is current. Also, I suggested the agent that I should have received the credit of past purchase in my account and my account should show a credit from now onwards. \\n\\nLater when I was not getting the statement, I called up XXXX  card to verify why I can\\'t login or check my account ONLINE. While checking they confirmed the address provided was wrong and they updated my account detail and enabled my online login. \\n\\nWhile checking the online statement, I saw again that my account is not current and I requested them to send my the statement of last 6 months because in the month of XXXX, I moved to a new apartment. They never send me the statement. \\n\\nCome XX/XX/XXXX, I logged in to my account and I saw that my account once again keep on increasing and there was a large amount outstanding in form of Late Fee plus interest rate. I once again call the customer care and inquired about the reason behind this. PLEASE note that all these calls went on for around 2 hours wherein me as a customer has to be in a ping pong stage all this time and none of the agent makes any note to the account. So, everytime I call I have to explain everything from scratch and all calls goes 2+ hours. This year I have already called and email 5 plus time without any success. \\n\\nI have never made any purchase this year and till now company keeps on charging late fee and the interest. \\n\\nAgain in the month of XX/XX/XXXX, after staying on the call for 2 hours, agent suggested that there was a credit issues in form of a cheque to me but I stated I have never received that cheque. Agent suggested that they will reissue the credit and to stop this late fee plus interest charge, please make the remaining payment. I made the payment again just to make my account current and also made the request to the agent that PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS NOT GETTING REPORTED TO CREDIT BUREAU as this is XXXX system problem and me as a customer should not be getting impacted. They accepted my request and I thought from now on everything is fine. \\n\\nCome XX/XX/XXXX, I went to XXXX  store to buy few stuff. At the counter I was told your card is not working. I said it should be and I can\\'t believe that even though there is any outstanding amount HOW CAN THEY BLOCK MY CARD WITHOUT any information for me ( not any email or letter ). At the store the lady at the counter connected me to the customer care and once again I have to repeat the whole story. Agent told me that we will go to the bottom of this and assist you. It was again 2+ hours and I was in the store with my family waiting for the resolution of this issue once for all. But again it was getting delayed and the only option agent can tell me is the best option is please pay the amount by cash and whtever is outstanding XXXX  customer support will take care and will revert back. Despite the fact the agent agrees that there is an outstanding credit which I should receive ( can\\'t imagine why it takes 1 to 2  month!! ) and all the charges was ongoing late fee plus interest rate, he was suggesting that system has no way to stop all these charges even though it was not at all my mistake. I also asked the agent whether they make any note in the account when a customer calls so that he/she don\\'t have to repeat again and again from scratch, he said yes we keep note of it. Later as there was no way he can confirm that the issue will be resolved, I dropped the call. Once again on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, I called back the customer care just to check whether any note was mentioned by the earlier agent with whom I was on the call from store for around 2 plus hour, to my utter disbelief there was no note and this time too the agent was telling me \"\" you have an outstanding balance and do you want to pay it \\'\\'. \\n\\nDuring the call on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX time XXXX hours, when I requested that I need to talk to the manager, the agent told me that manager will call after 48 hours. when I stress on the fact that can you make sure that the case note is made, he said yes and slowly disconnected my call. Can\\'t believe in this 21st century this is the way a company like XXXX handles a customer call. \\n\\nWith this complain I would like to make sure : - My issue gets corrected once for all ( My account should have XXXX balance, all the credit bureau report for last 5 months should be corrected OR there should not be any -ve reporting to the credit bureau for this account ) - the company should be liable for such casual way of handling such issue - the company should be serious about the way they deal with customer and there needs to be a feedback mechanism - in case company block the card they need to provide an information or early warning and in case the fault lies with Company they should compensate the consumer. \\n\\n- the customer care team should be taken to task for being so unprofessional. \\n\\nHope this issue gets resolved and I don\\'t have to go through all this trauma of XXXX card. \\n\\nLooking forward to hear from your end With best regards, XXXX', \"On XX/XX/2019 I called Bank of America to inquire about balance transfer offers because my online account page said I needed to contact them to provide more information on my account. After providing the information requested, they responded by lowering the credit limits on the two cards I have with BofA by over $4,000, or basically all of my available credit. The reasoning was that the amount owed on one or more of my cards was too high. One card was at about 50% of the limit, while the other was near 70% of the limit. When I asked what an appropriate debt to limit percentage was, to avoid this issue in the future, they said they were not able to share that with me, and that there was nothing they could do about the credit limit decrease. My feeling is that the real issue is that I have used low or 0% balance transfer offers to keep my interest rates low on my accounts. BofA has increased my credit limit and even offered me a new card in the last few years, and continued to extend 0% balance transfer offers up until XX/XX/2019. It seems they view me as a credit risk because I keep a low interest rate. By lowering my credit limit they have now increased my debt to credit limit ratio, which will negatively effect my credit score until it is paid off. My interest rate on the debt I carry with them will now rise from nearly 0% to over 25%. This is absolutely predatory lending. If they didn't want me to use the 0% balance transfer offers, don't extend them to me, but lowering my credit limits seems counterintuitive to the reason they gave me for why they were lowering them in the first place.\", 'Related to Report : XXXX. \\n\\n1.

In XXXX, I made a {$650.00} payment to Fifth Third over the phone. \\n\\nMy issue is that when I tried to make the payment in XXXX, the representative said my account was closed and that I have to go into a branch to make the payment. When I went into the branch, the representative said he will see what is going on. I never heard back from him. In XXXX, I tried to make both XXXX and XXXX payment but they would not take my payment over the phone. So I went to another representative at a local branch and demand for them to find out what is going on. The representative reached out to me yesterday saying that my account is in-house collections because my account was late. I was furious because my account was late due to the run around I was getting from Fifth third but he mentioned it was late since XXXX. I know that was not true because I made the payment on the XXXX each month. The phone representative always said my payment will be posted on the same day I paid ( excluding holidays ). I received no mail notification and now I have a late payment on my credit report and I do not think I should have that reporting on my credit.

The case number for that dispute being XXXX. \\n\\nI was given a credit for the amount in dispute, but found out this was reversed on XXXX XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX ). I was informed XXXX had provided sufficient evidence. This was a scan containing the gift card numbers they supplied me. \\n\\nI tried reasoning, saying why would I need to pay for the same flight if the gift cards were valid? I stated they ( Discover ) would see another transaction, this time from XXXX themselves, for the flight, as a charge. And I did have to charge the flight, the purchase occurring on Sunday, XX/XX/XXXX, at the terminal. I also uploaded this itinerary, showing the same flight number, dates, passengers, destination, etc as matching the original made on XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nI was informed by someone at Discover, perhaps XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX ( I spoke with so many people at so many different times trying to get this resolved the exact date eludes me ) that if I could get it in writing from XXXX that the gift cards were fraudulent, that would really help my cause. \\n\\nI submitted in writing that request to XXXX XXXX on Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX. I did not receive a response until Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, and it was vague at best, stating the reservation had been canceled due to a dispute that was filed against the purchase. \\n\\nThis was not sufficient for Discover. \\n\\nI then got it in writing, from XXXX after filing a XXXX complaint against XXXX, on XX/XX/XXXX, stating the following : \"\" ... in reviewing our records, I found that the XXXX gift cards ( listed below ) that you mentioned acquiring from XXXX were purchased through unauthorized activity. \\nXXXX | {$200.00} XXXX | {$200.00} XXXX | {$200.00} XXXX | {$200.00} Once this was brought to our attention, all reservations associated with the gift cards were canceled, and the money was returned to the credit cards used to purchase these cards from XXXX XXXX initially.

Also said they left a voice mail which I never received. They indicated I should contact Post Office for tracking, Post office said they said do not do tracking on letters. Contacted Macys again and said nothing they can do. This discrepancy lowered my credit scores 100 points. Contacted credit score services, XXXX, XXXX. After investigation said theres nothing they can do. Asked what type of investigation was performed, but could not respond. XX/XX/2019 went to credit department for Macys in XXXX, Az but said they dont handle such matters. They recommended going to service department in an actual Macys store. When I did go to store they told me there is nothing they can do. Therefore no recourse for Macys errors.\\n\"I applied for and opened a new Spark Business Rewards Credit Card in the beginning of XX/XX/2019. Before I received it my wife received an offer for the SAME card with better promotional terms/bonuses AND and lower annual fee. Upon calling the company they informed me that nothing could be done without closing the account, reapplying for the new card with a new credit check and new inquiries on the credit report ( which was done one week prior ).\\n\\nI understand the promotional terms change on cards from time to time and that is perfectly acceptable. But these more beneficial promotional terms are being unfairly sent to specific people. New promotions are not being offered to all of the public equally. Understandably, certain promotions are based on credit worthiness, but everyone should equally be given the chance to apply for a card with same promotional terms available.. The application process should be used to determine if one \\'s credit worthiness is sufficient to receive the particular card. Still, as of today ( XX/XX/19 ), these promotions are NOT being offered on the capital one website to the general public, but are being solicited to specific individuals ( regardless if they own a business or not ). I applied for my card on the website without any solicitation and was not offered these terms and I am still not being offered these terms. I understand the purpose of solicitations, however unequal treatment of who these terms are being offered too and not making them available to anyone applying for the card is unacceptable, not to mention discriminatory.', 'On XXXX XXXX 2019 my PayPal credit Card was charge for a purchase I made at XXXX and XXXX online. I received the merchandise ( a dress ). I tried it on and it didnt fit nor did I like the clingy material. Very inappropriate for a XXXX year old woman.

Today, I receive a box from XXXX and XXXX with the dress inside and a form letter indicating that the dress was unsalable. When I called the store the service representative indicated that it was the warehouse decision and there hands were tied and that the dress was mine to keep. \\n\\nThis is the most outrageous, openly fraudulent activity I have experienced. I never wore the dress and had it on for less than a minute.

The booking was made with an online travel agent known as XXXX. I made an online payment of a deposit of {$5000.00} to the \"\" online agent \\'\\' to be paid to the hotels specified for specified dates. I used my American Express Platinum Card for this transaction. The terms were \"\" 100 % refundable if cancelled more than 90 days in advance of the trip \\'\\'. I was advised that all bookings were confirmed in XXXX by this \"\" agent \\'\\' and deposits made. \\n\\nIn XX/XX/XXXX 2018 I received a call from another travel agent who said some of the hotels were not available for the dates agreed. I was confused by this as the bookings had supposedly been confirmed in XX/XX/XXXX2018. I immediately contacted all the other hotels and upon checking with the hotels, I discovered nothing had been booked in my name or by/on behalf of this agent for me. I researched online and found many fraud warnings and reports that this \"\" agent \\'\\' was an online fraudulent operation, with rip-off reports files, consumer complaints, stories of theft and fraud. I immediately sent a request to cancel this trip to this \"\" agent \\'\\' and demand a full refund since this was over 90 days before the \"\" trip \\'\\' ( 180 days in fact ). The agent kept reassuring me that they would refund me \"\" ONCE THEY RECEIVED THE REFUND FROM THE XXXX XXXX XXXX HOTELS \\'\\'. They produced phony receipts and fraudulent booking confirmations that the hotels have assured me were fake. I have confirmation from XXXX XXXX XXXX hotels that there were no payments or bookings made in my name by or on behalf of this \"\" agent \\'\\'.

I found out that this merchant seems to be operating online by selling \"\" tours \\'\\' using the name of a legitimate franchise to advertise, but not being a legitimate franchisee. This operation has no legitimate business address except online, and their payment information and operating name is in fact different from the franchise name they use online to trap the unsuspecting public or consumer. Instead of American Express investigating the fraud, they advised me that once I had given my credit card number out to a merchant, it was not a fraud, but was a \"\" dispute \\'\\' and the merchant was the one who had the benefit of the doubt. The merchant produced phony bookings that did not refer to me ( my  name was nowhere on the documentation ), and the merchant produced a new set of terms not connected to their website, trying to exclude my weeks of travel from the cancellable clause online ( all documentation was sent to American Express ) yet American Express still did not reverse the charge. I sent American Express written confirmation from the hotel groups that these bookings were not legitimate and never made by this alleged agent, and no payments were ever received by these hotel groups from this merchant. American Express is obliged to protect the consumer/customer for goods and services not received. American Express initially reversed this charge in my favor, yet have rebilled me. I reopened the dispute and sent them the full information again, yet they rebilled me again without any regard for the evidence produced. I reported this as fraud again and they once again sent it to the disputed department. Each time, they credited the account and then reversed the charge and rebilled me. This has been going on from XX/XX/XXXX 2018 until XX/XX/XXXX 2019, when I again received a letter advising me that we would be rebilled the {$5000.00}. There is no other choice for us than to file this complaint.

During XX/XX/XXXX I made these payments : XX/XX/XXXX {$2000.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$240.00} and XX/XX/XXXX $ XXXX.The payment date for the XXXX statement was XX/XX/XXXX. The new balance for XXXX was {$4300.00} with a payment due date of XX/XX/XXXX. I made a payment on XX/XX/XXXX for {$2500.00} that is not showing on this statement because no payments were showing but I paid the {$2500.00} before the due date. I did not pay this month in full and accrued interest of {$45.00} which I do not debate. Then in XXXX my amount owed was {$370.00} with a due date of XX/XX/XXXX. I paid XX/XX/XXXX {$130.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$2500.00} and XX/XX/XXXX {$5700.00}. I paid all purchases besides the pending purchases which were the {$370.00} before the credit card close date. I accrued interest which I disputed of {$75.00}. I was told by TWO citi representatives if I pay the credit card off full in two consecutive months, then the interest would stop accruing. So on XX/XX/XXXX I paid XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX XXXX as the purchases posted. Then on XX/XX/XXXX I paid the remaining posted purchases of {$820.00} before the credit card close date and YET they still charged me interest of {$6.00}.

This is by far the worst credit card I have ever had. Citi does not allow customers to pay pending purchases online and XXXX XXXX allowed me to. I could eliminate some stress if it allowed me to pay pending purchases but they are using this as leverage to charge interest to customers.I don\\'t see how a credit card company can charge interest when the card was paid in full.', 'I had a minimum payment of {$27.00} due on XX/XX/2019. I paid {$27.00} via my online account, deducting from my checking account on XX/XX/2019. This {$27.00} payment cleared my bank on XX/XX/2019. I verified with my bank that the funds had been paid out. I logged into my credit account online to check my available credit on XX/XX/2019. The payment was still pending due to it being the weekend and not a weekly business day. I called card services and spoke with a representative who explained this to me and advised me that the payment would reflect on that following Monday, XX/XX/2019. Once this happened, my available credit limit would update. I logged into my credit account online again on Wednesday, XX/XX/2019 and the {$27.00} e-payment does reflect as being paid on XX/XX/2019. However, my available credit limit had not changed. I contacted card services again on XX/XX/2019 and spoke first with a representative and then a supervisor. Both of these individuals told me that the {$27.00} payment had been received but had not yet been posted. The explanation provided to me was that, because several months prior a payment was returned, and therefore this current payment would not be posted to my account until I gave them permission to contact my bank directly. ( The returned payment was resolved within days of the first returned payment. I also paid the fee due to that occurrence. ) I refused to do so because I felt they had no right to contact my bank to discuss my personal bank account. The supervisor I spoke with stated that unless I allowed them to do so, the payment would not be posted to my account. She stated that the payment may eventually post, at least 14 days from that date, XX/XX/2019. \\n\\nI reviewed the credit card agreement online which states : \"\" You agree to pay us in United States dollars.

However, we may delay restoring your available Credit Limit in the amount of the payment to make sure we receive the funds. \\'\\' I contacted my bank again to inquire about the credit card company \\'s demands to have access to discussing my bank account. The bank representative stated that this rarely occurs, only on a 3-way phone call, and that she personally had never heard of it happening for a {$27.00} payment. \\n\\nMy concern is not only with the questionable delay in posting my payment, which both my bank and the credit card company acknowledge to have been cleared, but also with the fact that the agreement does not put a specific number of days regarding \"\" ... delay restoring your available credit limit ... \\'\\' Seemingly, they could delay this restoration for as long as they want. That is extremely worrisome to me. \\n\\nI have continued in refusing the credit card company to contact my bank ; to threaten me by stating they will not post the payment unless I give them this permission is absurd.

I had set up my personal bank account to pay reoccurring payments and at the end of the month there is no or little money left until I replenish the account for the coming month. In XX/XX/XXXX of  this year I accidentally paid manually before the bill was due and before I had actually replenished my pay account at my bank and it ended up showing NSF in spite of the fact I still paid it BEFORE it was due. Then on the XX/XX/XXXX of this year I forgot about auto pay and paid manually on the due date. Well as it turns out the auto pay sent the automatic pay request into my bank after the payment had already been received and paid by my bank so the payment was made on time but he auto pay payment was rejected this led to another NSF but it had already been paid. Then the bank closed my account not taking into account that there was a mistake made, when I contacted Synchrony bank they ask me to send in proof that it had been paid, I did so, they have the proof. when I contacted them again on the XX/XX/XXXX and inquired about the matter I was treated rudely which caused my great XXXX which I suffer from, and XXXX also, I'm not supposed to be stressed like this.

I called Citi and was informed that I needed to call the XXXX office because everything about my account was with them. I called the XXXX office/funded by Citi and was informed that the {$400.00} was credited towards late and finance fees. I am thinking that if this {$400.00} was refunded for a promotion at the time of purchase, I wouldn\\'t have even owed the {$100.00} so how is it legal that they took the refund and applied it to late fees and finance fees that I would have never had if that promotion was applied?

I am writing to plead for assistance from The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and ask for a thorough investigation with American Express, as they are condoning, disregarding and quite frankly encouraging fraudulent behaviors from their vendors/merchants. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, my American Express credit card was charges 11 times for a total amount of {$8800.00} from a merchant named XXXX XXXX. I only authorized/signed for 2 charges - {$190.00} and {$1000.00}. I contacted American Express immediately once I noticed the pending charges. In speaking to the agent/representative, we were convinced the charges were an error as there were numerous and duplicate charges minutes apart from each other. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, all the charges posted and I immediately contacted American Express. The agent explained to me that they will open a billing dispute/inquiry with the merchant and made me feel comfortable that the charges are inaccurate and AMEX will get to the bottom of it. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email with an AMEX Message. The message was a note from the merchant stating that I am a regular customer and a copy of 5 out of 11 receipts. I have never been to this establishment prior to XX/XX/XXXX. I reviewed the receipts and noticed my signature was forged on 4 of the 5 receipts ( the {$190.00} receipt being the only one I signed/authorized ). I did not authorized nor was I aware of the 4 other receipts. None of the descriptions on the receipts decipherable. Once again I immediately contacted AMEX, and explained them the charges were fraudulent and my signature was forged. They transferred me to the Fraud department and I was assured that AMEX is going to initiate a thorough investigation. \\n\\nOn XXXX XXXX, I called AMEX looking for a status update and an update on the remaining receipts. The agent/representative explained to me the investigation is still pending and they have not received the additional receipts. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I returned a call to the Fraud department as they left me a voicemail. The agent/representative from the Fraud dept. explained to me that the fraud team will not investigate this case because I was present at the establishment with the card. The agent/representative requested I contact customer care to continue to investigate the case. I did not understand how this is not fraud as I did not authorize these charges and my signature was forged. I was told by the agent on XX/XX/XXXX that this was fraud and she transferred me to the fraud team. If this is not fraud I do not know what is Either way, I then contacted customer care again and the agent/representative explained to me that there is not much more AMEX can do for me and to figure out an alternative route. I was so devastated and disappointed with the agent/representative approach and response that I had to end the phone call. I took some time to compose myself from the disappointing way the previous agent/representative address the situation. I called back a few hours later and requested to speak to a supervisor. The supervisor ( XXXX ) came on the line and immediately repeated the same message the previous agent/representative provide me ( there is not much more AMEX can do for me and to figure out an alternative route ) without listening to my concerns. I explained to her that I do not feel this was handled accordingly from AMEX from the very beginning. \\ni.e. \\nHow AMEX allowed 11 simultaneous charges minutes apart from each other There are 4 separate cases/inquires open and the agent/representative could not explain why 4 were open vs 1. They could also not explained why 1 was closed out the other 3 were still open nor can I decipher why The agent/representative agreed this was fraud and transferred me to the Fraud dept., the Fraud dept. did not even investigate the case even though I did not authorize these charges and my signature was forged The agents/representatives and supervisor could not provide me any updates on the case or updates on the remaining receipts on every call I made to customer care.\\n\\nThere was a credit on my account for {$1100.00} ( {$390.00}, {$290.00}, {$290.00} and {$190.00} ). Two agent/representative could not explain the credit and the supervisor ( XXXX ) stated the credit was from the merchant b/c of the duplicated charges. Shortly after this was explained to me, I receive an email stating the credit is being reversed. \\nCommunication and updates have been poor and inadequate The signatures and handwriting on the receipts are visibly and clearly mismatched ( Please see attached ) At this point, I contacted and engaged the District Attorneys office to notify them of the fraud and unjust business practice from this merchant. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I send an email to a member of the American Express Leadership team, to express my concerns on how American Express has managed and addressed the investigation/matter. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from an American Express Executive Assistant, stating they have received my email and are reviewing my inquires and concerns. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from the same American Express Executive Assistant, with an attached resolution letter stating We have extensively researched your concerns and determined all claims were investigated and correctly decisioned, because of the fact I was present at the establishment. Their outcome of all claims resulted in the following credits : {$1900.00} ( Vendor/Merchant entered an incorrect authorization code ), {$500.00} ( tip amount from the {$1500.00} charge ), {$400.00} ( tip amount from the {$1100.00} charge ), and {$80.00} ( tip amount from the {$200.00} charge ).\\n\\nI responded with my concern that this was not thoroughly and extensively reviewed as they stated. And requested a call to discuss the actions and steps that were taken to extensively research my concerns. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke to the same American Express Executive Assistant, to review and address my concerns. I ask a number of questions and what steps/process were taken regarding how American Express came to their decision. She was very abrupt and refused to answer specific questions. Her common response was You were at the establishment. I explained to her that their vendor/merchant had possession of my American Express Credit Card for the duration of my stay at their business. During that time span, they processed 11 separate simultaneous charges without my authorization. They then provided you 10 receipts with signatures and handwriting that are visibly & clearly mismatched and forged. Because I was at the establishments does not mean I authorized the charges. Below are a few of the concern I attempted to discuss with the American Express Executive Assistant to no avail. \\nWhy was I, nor the vendor/merchant, not physically contacted ( Called ) during the investigation Did American Express review the Merchants history An explanation of the Charges ( I can not decipher the descriptions on the receipts And the merchant would not return my call ) Why certain tips were credited and not others. \\no Her explanation was, any receipt with an X marked on the line for a tip would be credited. \\no There were receipts with X marked on the tip line that were credited and not credited o She stated she will look into why there was inconsistency on American Express \\'s part with the credit issued for the tips Why was only one charge of {$1900.00} was credited.\\n\\no She states the Vendor/Merchant entered an incorrect authorization code o I requested the purpose and meaning of entering the authorization and she refused to explain it to me.\\n\\nWhy did I not receive all of the requested receipts until weeks/months later from American Express ... I requested them numerous times and they finally provided 10 out of the 11 receipts to me in batches when they clearly had all of them from the beginning. ( I am still missing 1 receipt including the receipt I signed for {$1000.00} ) I received endless inconsistency with the credits provided. I was provided numerous credits on separate occasions and then the credits were removed on separate occasions. As a matter of fact, shortly after my call with the American Express Executive Assistant, where she went through and confirmed my credits, I received notice the same credit is being removed.\\n\\nInconsistent messaging form American Express employees o The numerous/separate cases caused inconsistent responses/messages from the customer care agents every time I called in. The Communication and updates were poor and inadequate. Each Customer Care Agents provided me a different and inaccurate update or were not able to provide me any updates at all.\\n\\nThe signatures and handwriting on the receipts are visibly and clearly mismatched ( Please see attached ) How AMEX allowed 11 simultaneous charges minutes apart from each other, while the vendor/merchant had possession of my Credit Card. They provided you 10 receipts with signatures and handwriting that are visibly & clearly mismatched and forged. \\n\\n\\nI am pleading with The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to investigate this matter. The fact that American Express accepts/allows this vendor to provide dishonest business practice and fraud to any patron is unacceptable, disturbing and frightening.

I paid {$110.00}. When we arrived we showed up to the front desk and purchased wristbands. We were talking to their associate at the front desk for about 15 minutes after we already made a purchase because we were confused as to how it works. The associate didnt thoroughly explain so we just said wed figure it out. We walked around the entire place for about a Half hour trying to figure out what rides our younger children could get on. Not to mention the wait time that we had to wait to get on. They could only get on 2 rides by their self. While we were in line our son came to us and asked what else could he do? He played all of the arcade games already. We were confused because it had only been about 20 minutes. He said that a lot of the games were broken and a lot of the arcade games were exactly the same. We then went up to the front and We asked the supervisor if we could have our money back because our children could not get on any rides and we were unhappy about our son not getting any use out of his arcade pass. The supervisor straight up said no because we have been there for over an hour but in reality we were trying to figure out what our children could get on. He also mentioned that the arcade pass was very useful because there were over 60 arcade games when that wasnt true. I pointed out that a lot of his arcade games were broken and I also pointed out that there might be 60 arcade games but theyre all repetitive so in reality there is not 60 arcade games and the manager didnt say anything about that he just said we cant give you your money back. I was very distraught and my children were very sad because they couldnt get on anything. The signs were not clear. If they were we wouldnt have stood in line talking to the cashier 15 minutes after we already purchased the tickets be supervisor was very unhelpful throughout the whole ordeal and he wasnt willing to help us in anyway possible. I tried to dispute the charge with my bank and my bank Basically told me that I authorized the purchase when that wasnt even what the dispute was about. My bank accidentally put down my dispute was not as described. My dispute was about unsatisfied by services that werent rendered. they basically took the business side over mine.

I followed up today, XX/XX/2019, after I had still not received the refund check promised only to find out that the refund had been issued to my Shop Your Way card on XX/XX/2019 without my knowledge and with no notice. What is more, during this time ( or recently ) my card apparently was issued a new card number, but no one notified me or even sent me a new card. So I had to sort through that confusion as well. I still do not have a card with the new card number. \\n\\nMy card had a {$0.00} balance so my money has just been sitting there with a negative balance this entire time ( earning interest no doubt ). It is, I believe, standard practice to eventually cut a check when there is a negative balance on a card for a prolonged period of time ( especially a large balance such as this one ). However, it is clear that there was no plan on the part of Citi/Sears to do this. ( Incidentally, my refund was reduced by {$89.00} plus tax for a home visit to service my refrigerator ; however, this was incorrectly charged, as the visit was covered under the regular 1 year manufacturer \\'s warranty - Now waiting on Sears to refund this as well, which I presume will also go to my credit card ). \\n\\nI have called the card \\'s customer service phone number three times today at different times. I have held for very long periods of time, and still no answer. \\n\\nThe final straw is the message I received in the \"\" secure message center \\'\\' following my message sent earlier today, in which I requested to receive my funds immediately. The message reads as follows : We received your recent inquiry regarding your account. We are unable to issue a refund at this time. A credit has been issues for an item in dispute. If the dispute is resolved in your favor, then a refund will be processed at that time. Please let us know if we can be of further assistance. \\n\\nObviously, this reply is completely unresponsive to the matter at hand. Since no one answers the phone, I have decided to allow the CFPB the opportunity to issue a directive to one of the major banking institutions in our country, requiring it to be responsive to clients.

I came to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and the cab driver took me to a restaurant in XXXX, where I was forced to give my credit card even though there was absolutely no service provided. \\nThe name of the restaurant was in XXXX and hence I could not read. There were 2 charges that was made at the place on the same day on my credit card were {$1400.00} & {$2400.00}. \\n\\nCitibank responded to my dispute by sending a sales receipt from the merchant. \\n\\nI responded to them saying the sales receipt is totally fake and also my sign was forged. The charges show some amount like {$250.00} for mixed fruit and {$900.00} as some drink. I am pretty sure they do not even have a menu with the amounts. \\n\\nAlso the receipt shows {$1100.00}, while I was charged {$1400.00} and {$2400.00} on the same day. I sent a reply to Citi asking the merchant to provide explanation for the same? \\n\\nThis is totally an extortion where in these people are fleecing foreign customers. I had called the Citibank customer service on the same day to inform regarding the fraud committed and to dispute the charges. \\n\\nThe cab driver who took me to the place was XXXX and his number is : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The XXXX authorities are trying to nab this person but looks like he has absconded from XXXX. A formal case has been registered with the XXXX authorities. \\n\\nI have asked Citibank that the charges immediately withdrawn from my card. The investigation is taking too long and I am not confident if the same will be resolved. I have called the customer service multiple times but not much information is received other than the case is being investigated.', 'Back on XX/XX/XXXX I notified Chevron of fraudulent charges posted to my statement. The representative took the information advised that in 7-10 days the Fraud Department would call us for additional information is necessary. Then it would take from 30-50 days to completely resolve. I had to actually request that the representative cancel the card and issue a new one which was unfortunate since we would be traveling in the next week. I pay off the statement monthly and do not carry a balance. This included the fraudulent charges totaling {$75.00}. I asked about the charges and was advised I\\'d have to pay or I would accrue interest. I made the complete payment under direst. The new card was received and activated a week later. When activating, I asked about the Fraud Case and was given the same information ; resolution takes between 30-60 days. Calls were placed to Chevron again on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX as this would be 30 and 60 days after the original claim. No resolution case being researched. On XX/XX/XXXX a call was placed to Chevron once again to follow up. Was advised by a Supervisor that the previous claim, \"\" was not completed \\'\\' correctly in their system. She could see all the notes and the original representative would be re-educated to assure this does not happen again in the future. On XX/XX/XXXX the card was put on hold as we were traveling. It took almost 12 hours to receive a text from Chevron Fraud. When we spoke with them we advised that we were indeed traveling and we attempted to use the card, asked about the Fraud Case from XX/XX/XXXX. Once again we were told that there was an error. They could not explain why the case has not yet been reviewed or researched. I asked for a Supervisor or Manager to escalate as we are now at 134 days without any research being performed. The representative ( XXXX ) stated there was no one above her and \"\" she knew how to do her job \\'\\'. Feeling that after multiple call and no resolution I was not satisfied and had no faith in their process. Concerned about our account and credit I asked to cancel the card. She proceeded to cancel the card and said there was nothing anyone could do for me and hung up. I immediately called back again to place a complaint on the representative ( XXXX ) as well as the entire process. I asked for the case to be escalated as I understood from the FTC that the creditor must resolve the dispute within two billing cycles ( but not more than 90 days ). Again I was told that it has now been correctly entered and I would hear back from Fraud with in 7-10 days. Nothing additional could be done at this time. I would greatly appreciate your assistance in investigating this matter. I am requesting to have the funds paid to be credited back to my account. This ordeal has caused me unwarranted and unnecessary inconvenience and stress. I thank you in advance for your prompt response and I look forward to hearing from you very soon.\"\\nI have a credit card through Chase Bank. I have three different balances on the card each with their own interest rates. I made the minimum payment and then made two other payments hoping they would go towards the balance with the highest interest rate ( cash advance ). It did not.

I was told that The Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 would force credit card companies to apply excess payments that blling cycle to the balance with the highest interest rate first.

I submitted documents related to the dispute on the same day through secure messaging on their website and also by fax. I received a secure message from NFCU on XX/XX/2019 confirming that they had \"\" received \\'\\' and are \"\" reviewing \\'\\' the documents. I subsequently received a letter through regular mail from them, asking me to contact them to answer whether or not I attempted to resolve the dispute with the merchant prior to filing the dispute with NFCU. I called NFCU the same day, and I confirmed to the representative I spoke with that I did indeed attempt to resolve the dispute with the merchant prior to filing the claim. She then told me to disregard the mailed letter and to expect a follow-up letter containing the results of my dispute. \\nAfter receiving no such letter, I called NFCU and asked for the dispute results. The representative told me that my billing correction request was denied without offering an explanation. I then asked to speak with a supervisor. After a lengthy hold, I spoke with the supervisor. She denied that NFCU had received the dispute-documents. After explaining to her that I had received written communication that the documents I submitted were properly received, she asked me to send them again. I sent them again by secure messaging through NFCU \\'s website. She then said that she did not receive them. I sent the documents again, and again she denied receiving them. I sent them another time. This time, she confirmed receipt but immediately claimed that I had no right to recover the payment. She assumed that I was saying I was unhappy with the results of the Mediation, and that is why I want my money back. I said no such thing, nor did I intimate anything like that. I want my money back because the attorney violated the retainer agreement : ( 1 ) She refused to continue work on the Mediation without extra payments from me despite our written and verbal agreement of a {$2000.00} fixed fee for the Mediation. ( 2 ) She refused to file the petition that was offered and accepted during the Mediation unless paid more money.\\n\\n( 3 ) She ceased work immediately without providing the 10-day notice required by the terms of the retainer agreement/contract. \\n\\nI explained this to the NFCU supervisor but I don\\'t think she understood the situation.

I explained to them how I never received any emails and he looked up my account and told me that they had my wrong email address, he said it was my fault, he was very rude to me and told me that I could pay {$160.00} today, but if I do not pay right at that moment then the amount would go back up to over {$200.00}.

This contact was within the 30-day period allowed in the cardmember agreement for closing the card for a full annual fee refund. \\n\\nWhen I reached a customer service representative and communicated my intention to close my account because I did not want to pay the annual fee, the representative offered to downgrade my Blue Cash Preferred account to the Blue Cash Everyday product. \\n\\nIn my communications with the representative, I understood the offer to mean that upon the completion of the downgrade process, I would be able to keep the credit card account open and have my annual fee refunded. I had not made use of the card since XX/XX/XXXX and this appeared to be a logical and reasonable retention offer from Amex. \\n\\nI accepted the offer given by the representative. My online account reflected the change in card product, and I later received updated cards and documents reflecting the change. However, sometime later, I checked the card account activity online and noticed that the \"\" ADJUST MEMBERSHIP FEE \\'\\' transaction was a credit only in the amount of {$87.00}, rather than the full {$95.00} I was expecting. \\n\\nOn the afternoon of XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted customer service again via telephone to inquire about the discrepancy. The representative I spoke to mentioned something about the amount being a result of annual fee proration, but offered to submit a dispute inquiry for the discrepancy in what I was expecting. I was placed on a hold for several minutes, but the representative never returned back to the line and it appeared that the call was ultimately dropped. \\n\\nLater in the day, I contacted customer service again to inquire again about my issue, as I did not believe I had concluded my business in the previous call. This time, the representative I spoke to said something to the effect that my reduced refund was a result of my card having been open at the time the fee was assessed, and that my request to adjust the amount of the annual fee would not be considered. \\n\\nAssuming that what the representative stated was accurate, I am troubled for several reasons. The first is that, assuming that I have characterized the policy correctly, the proration of annual fees even for downgrade requests within 30 days after the assessment of the annual fee was not clearly communicated to me. I do not recall the representative with whom I requested account closure say that the annual fee assessed would not be refunded to me in full. If I had been aware of this fact, I would have chosen to close the card account instead. \\n\\nThe second reason is that the annual fee refund posted past the 30-day period mentioned in the cardholder agreement in which I would be entitled to a full annual fee refund if I closed the account. If this had happened earlier within the cancellation window, I could have had the opportunity to change my mind and decide to close the account instead. At this point in time, I am outside the stated period, so a request to close the account now would not have any effect on the annual fee refund. \\n\\nIn addition, this proration policy was unexpected to me, having dealt with annual fee refunds from account downgrades and closures with other issuers before ( e.g., XXXX and XXXX XXXX ). In those situations, I have received full annual fee refunds whenever they were requested within the stated annual fee refund period. Amex \\'s policy does not seem to be in line with the practices of other credit card issuers. \\n\\nI will also observe that, as I had not used my card for purchases since XX/XX/XXXX, I could hardly be claimed to be taking advantage of Amex \\'s annual fee refund policy by making use of card benefits just before requesting an annual fee refund by account closure. If I had requested full account closure in my original contact with customer service, I don\\'t believe I would be in this situation now. \\n\\nTo date, I have had mostly positive interactions with Amex, and I have other card accounts with Amex. I feel that on this issue, however, I have been misled by Amex customer service, preventing me from attaining the full annual fee refund by account closure that I originally intended. My customer service experience makes me reconsider whether I should continue to keep my card accounts open and use them for purchases in the future.', 'I had taken out a Synchrony Loan/Credit Card to finance a new AC for my parents ( who are elderly and my father is in end stage XXXX XXXX with XXXX ). I set up automatic payments on their website. I always choose \"\" pay balance \\'\\' on my credit cards to avoid interest. I did that with this one, too. They took out the full {$6300.00} from my bank account in lieu of the XXXX XXXX monthly installment. I quickly called and said there must be a mistake, please reverse the charge and I will make a payment over the phone immediately. I was advised that was not possible. They would send me a paper check for the difference and it would take 7-10 business days to arrive. I spoke to two \\'client managers \\' who told me they could not electronically refund the money, nor expedite the check issuance and/or XXXX the check. I was told a \\'client manager \\' is the highest person I am allowed to speak to. I can\\'t even do an electronic deposit for a {$6000.00} check. I would need to drive 30 minutes to my credit union. I explained all of this to them.

I called Capital One this XX/XX/2019 to have my ex-wife removed from an account she is a co-applicant. Back in XXXX I was exploring debt relief options and this was my reason for requesting her name be removed. Note she never used this account. I was told no problem by Capital One and they would remove her name. I also, asked my account be closed. Unfortunately, I failed to get documentation from Capital One she was removed from the account. Please NOTE I would never had closed this account without her name not being removed. I know enough that once an account is closed you definitely can not request a name to be removed. \\n\\nMy ex-wife messaged me the week of XX/XX/XXXX that her credit report showed late payment from Capital One. I was totally surprised and caught off guard because I thought her name had been removed. I began process of filing for XXXX XXXX Bankruptcy in early XXXX. I called Capital One twice and explained the situation. I was told whoever I spoke with back in XXXX mis-spoke. Again my fault for not having requested this documentation. \\n\\nI explained to Capital One I could email our Consent Order from our divorce spelling out I was solely responsible for this account. I pointed out that her credit was being affected it should not be. This fell on deaf ears as Capital One did not even want to see this Consent Order. I had been a loyal paying customer for over 15 years to Capital One. I am certain they made plenty of money off interest charges. Its just upsetting I was led to believe the ex-wifes name was removed only to find out I was lied to. How I wish we could play back our conversation as I know they record every call. \\n\\nI am hopeful someone from Capital One has compassion and a kind heart to recognize our situation and to correct this situation. I dont agree with my ex-wife on just about everything however, her credit should not take a hit given I was told Capital One would remove her name off the account. \\n\\nSincerely,', \"On XX/XX/2019, I went to XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Address : XXXX.

I gave my Bank of America XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to the attendant and he ran the card through his machine. He then told me it did not go through and he needed another card. I gave him a second Bank of America Mastercard to try. He ran the card through his machine and then told me it did not go through either. My fiance then gave the attendant his Bank of America credit card. The attendant said this charge went through. The attendant did not provide us with any receipts. \\n\\nWhen I looked at my credit card transactions on both cards, I saw that the charge from XXXX to my Bank of America XXXX credit card in the amount of {$100.00} and the charge from XXXX to my Bank of America Mastercard in the amount of {$84.00} both posted. The charge to my fiance 's credit card in the amount of {$60.00} also posted to his credit card. \\n\\nWhen I attempted to contact XXXX, I got a message saying the party was temporarily unavailable. I filed disputes on both transactions on XX/XX/19 through Bank of America and provided supporting documentation. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/2019, I received a letter from Bank of America stating that they were unable to determine that a billing error occurred and they issued a credit to my account for the disputed charge. The letter also stated that Bank of America was considering the dispute resolved but the merchant would have the opportunity to present new information on why the charges were valid. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/2019, I received another letter from Bank of America notifying me that they reviewed the details of my dispute on my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and were unable to pursue the dispute further. My Bank of America XXXX XXXX XXXX was then charged the original disputed amount of {$100.00}. I called Bank of America to ask why my account was charged and was told that XXXX provided signed receipts for the transactions and because it was a chipped transaction, they had to consider it valid, and I was required to pay it. I did not sign any receipts when I was at XXXX because the attendant told me his machine was not working. I requested an appeal of Bank of America 's decision but was told because the signed receipts were provided by XXXX, there was nothing I could do, even though I did not sign anything and the receipts must have been forged.\", 'I am submitting the second complaint to CFPB since I am not satisfied with the Bank of America responded to my complaint XXXX.

They have not ordered the permanent chargeback in the amount of {$9000.00} ( plus interest ) although it has settled chargebacks with other people who were also bilked by its Merchant-XXXX. \\n\\nInstead of providing me with the necessary items noted above, BoA has served as its Merchant-XXXX   acquiring, issuing and merchant bank. As the issuing bank, BoA originally authorized the charge, handled it by its credit card processing company, captured the charge and then deposited the funds into the account maintained at BoA for XXXX benefit. However, it has not done the same for me and I must be appeased. \\n\\nAlthough I have been challenging this credit card charge posted to my account since XX/XX/XXXX, BoA, as merchants XXXX bank, has not fulfilled its obligation to refund the amount of the charge to me. According to the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ),  if there is a credit card processor involved in this transaction, which I believe it is in this case, then the obligation to refund the {$9000.00} charge is contractually assumed by BoAs credit card processor. Although I have no idea who that credit card processor might be, the payment by the issuing bank should be credited to my credit card account effective immediately. BoA as XXXX merchant bank must seek reimbursement from its merchant XXXX, not me. I believe one of the reasons BoA is reluctant to provide me with the chargeback is that it might have failed to establish a reserve account to protect itself from high risk industries, such as those in which XXXX operated and consequently help the FTC to shut it down for having been a fraudulent/scamming company. However, it has refunded funds to others in the same situation as mine, thus clearly discriminating against me. \\n\\nThis is the fourth time that I have requested [ through the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) ] that Bank of America ( BoA ) provide the information and documentation sustaining its denial to issue a {$9000.00} charge back to account ending in XXXX. \\n\\nCFPB is the only recourse I must use to urge BoA to respond to my telephone calls and written communications. \\n\\nSince XX/XX/XXXX, I have been trying to communicate with BoAs Resolution Specialist Regulatory Complaints, XXXX XXXX via telephone and written communications to no avail.

Additionally, it states : Correspondence dated XX/XX/XXXX, explains that we [ BoA ] re-examined the claim and determined that we [ BoA ] were unable to further assist as we [ BoA ] did not receive the requested documentation. He continues to state in a separate paragraph that : Bank of America exercises all available options to resolve disputes with merchants. ( see attachment ) Since XX/XX/XXXX, through BoA online message center, I have provided BoA with any and all documentation it has requested from me. \\n\\nSince Mr. XXXX has not acknowledged my telephone calls nor my correspondence, on XX/XX/XXXX I called the dispute department ( again ).  After holding for 30 minutes, I spoke to XXXX ( in Texas ) who transferred me to another person  XXXX ( in Utah ) who in turn transferred me to her supervisor XXXX ( to an unknown location ). Although, they claimed they have reviewed the notes and documentation I have submitted, none of these people were able to inform me what was needed from me for BoA to order the chargeback. \\n\\nIn addition, there must be an oversight function which would have an inspector to review my case and give me the real story. I do not believe that BoA is being truthful in this matter. \\n\\nThank you for your time and I request that you reply to my dispute and give me a positive outcome.\"\\nXX/XX/XXXX I had contacted Synchrony bank to advise them that my Paypal account was a fraudulent account.

This is unacceptable - the account is less secure as I can not see the charges, I can not make payments on any of my active three credit cards. \\n\\nThis brings into question their disaster recovery story - how can it take a business more than two weeks to recover any aspect of an online service? \\n\\nDue to my many XXXX begging them to do their jobs and restore my access they have reminded me that I can pick up the phone and make payments to them over the phone.

Details of the shipping address or addresses of the merchandise are available with the police department of my city, as the stores are legally not allowed to release that data to me. \\n\\nI have had computer security issues for some months now, and this started when my identity was stolen in XXXX and the IRS spotted the fraudulent use of my social security number. \\n\\nI had received phishing emails in the last months of XXXX, two of my cards were used in places I did not go to, for purchases made through a third party I do not use. \\n\\nIn XXXX, I had issues with my computer screen where I had saved the XXXX telephone number that I used to call and be called from to deliver and pick up my computer after repairs. This telephone number is the very same number you would call if you have an XXXX subscription. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, after sending off to XXXX  Contact Support one of the phishing emails with fake purchases phishing for my XXXX XXXX, I get a call from that same XXXX   number, XXXX, which of course I picked up, thinking they were XXXX  calling to fix my computer security issues. \\n\\nAs it had turned out, a group posing as XXXX XXXX XXXX had masked the XXXX telephone number. The actors first give me a fake XXXX  Case number and then proceed to ask me to type commands on the XXXX app or the XXXX XXXX app on my XXXX to show me I had 139 hacking connections. I later learned from the XXXX XXXX XXXX   that is a tactic they use to make it appear that I have hacking connections, but they were merely wi-fi connections I had previously used. I am not an XXXX XXXX  technician and I know a million other XXXX users who would not know the difference. The actors then ask me what other signs I had been getting that I had security issues. I name all the issues I have been having. They then tell me I need security keys to de-hack my computer. This is where the gift cards come in. At a time of fear of losing work and family data accumulated over the years, I did what I was asked to do, which is buy the gift cards by the $ XXXX and sit in my car and give them the gift card numbers and their access codes. At the end of the first day, after spending at least a {$1000.00} on gift cards, I ask them how XXXX will pay me back. They then send me an email of refund for the same amount spent each day on gift cards. This occurred for four days in total. I would repeatedly ask each day how XXXX will refund me all that money. The actor would say, XXXX will not risk their reputation not paying you back for such a small amount. A fake checks picture is also produced on the third day for the total spent for three days. To increase the risk of having more hacking connections, I am told on the third day that my hacking connections were interfering with the XXXX servers, and this was when I get into an argument with them saying that if they really needed to fix my security issues, they should send a technician over or get me a XXXX  XXXX   appointment as quickly as possible. To this they replied they would have to turn off all my XXXX devices for seven days and that it would take them seven days to fix my computer. I said I could not do that because I had to travel out of state in the weekend. This gave them more reason to send me out to buy more cards and expedite the process. The other grueling part of this ordeal was when purchasing the gift cards, the stores would only have a policy of selling gift cards at {$1000.00} maximum per transaction. I had to dodge this in many ways that was humiliating and do and say things I would not normally do in groceries and stores. The scammers said that if I told the credit card companies that my computer was being hacked, they would block me off forever. This raised a red flag, but then I also had my computer security in mind, so that I was under duress the whole time. Finally on day four, when I had exhausted my credit, the actor posing as an XXXX   technician asked that I use my debit card, to which I said, There is money in there, but that is for my food. If I use that, I will not have any food money. He said, Theres no money in there? That was when I realized they were crooks after my cash. In the meantime, on the third day, they tell me that there were a few strong connections and suggested that my computer is being used by XXXX  users so that it will take more security keys to de-hack my computer. Catching up with work and exhausted by the third day, I almost gave in to losing my data to the alleged hackers. By the fourth day, the day before I was to travel, when they did not call at XXXX XXXX  as they did three days before, I decided to call them to finally fix my security issues. That was when I got the real XXXX people and learned I had been scammed. \\n\\nMy dispute to the credit card companies is where are the goods and services I paid for using the gift cards? I obviously did not get my computer fixed. I traced the merchandise trail the gift cards were used through XXXX XXXX XXXX  and XXXX, both being the main stores where most of the merchandise were bought. I was informed by both companies the merchandise were shipped to an address or addresses but not to mine, which now makes this a theft by deception crime, as I was informed by an XXXX detective. In the past, XXXX XXXX issued me refunds for fraudulent purchases made in another state when I was not present, for goods or services I did not use or receive. I am grateful those were dealt with promptly. What is the difference between my credit card being fraudulently used without me being present, versus paying for gift cards which were used to buy merchandise and shipped to recipients other than myself? Scam or no scam, I received nothing, as what had happened when I was not present when my debit card was fraudulently used. I did not get any services nor merchandise for any of the transactions, but a few companies did get the monies I am now supposed to be responsible to pay both American Express and XXXX XXXX Credit Card services.\"\\nAmerican Express are discrimination against me due to my XXXX under the American with disabilities act title III regarding my request under the Fair Credit Billing Act and the Federal Arbitration Act regarding the terms and conditions of the Credit Card agreement.\\n\"This complaint including GM Card/Capital One credit Card companies, and XXXX XXXX XXXX   XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. \\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX address : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, IL XXXX, phone : XXXX 1.

I looked up the company myself and the XXXX   have the company down as a possible fraudulent credit reporting agency with many problems. I tried to get in touch with the company but they keep saying the issue is going to get corrected but they never did, as a matter-of-fact, they can't even find my subscription. I even tried to log in to my supposed subscription and couldn't log in, it keeps giving me an error on my email address and I tried both of my emails. The American Express Serve customer service done the dispute but within 5 days they denied it. They did replace my debit card like that was going to refund my money back. The XXXX fraud company supposed to be monthly subscription but the was taking out more than once a month. They keep telling me to contact the company but it's not possible to get anything done with the company because it's a fraud, so they say they will fix the problem but don't.

In my original complaint, I communicated that I was told my transfer did not occur. I asked for the recording to be reviewed, because I was told time and again the transfer showed it did not happen, and that all of the fees should be returned to me. I waited for this to be corrected. I was assured by the management team on the phone that they were working to achieve this. So I waited. As interest accrued on my account, I was concerned ; which I communicated on every call. Now, because I was told this was going to be corrected, {$3800.00} worth of fees, and interest were assigned to my account I asked that the calls be pulled, and listened to, in an effort to have the facts confirmed, as this was a conversation in each call. In the letter dated XX/XX/XXXX from the office of the president, it states my call could not be substantiated. Moreover you will find a letter for a bank transfer we completed on XX/XX/XXXX for a completely separate 0 % transfer, from Barclays. I never received a letter like this for the transfer I am disputing. \\n\\nI had to go through the action of closing my account, just so I could capture confirmation that every call is recorded. You will read ( and hear ) in the call I recorded that there are notes stating I was told this was an error. \\n\\nNot only is Barclays withholding the interest in the amount of {$3800.00} ; they held a {$34000.00} over payment from my company for 7 weeks. They would not allow me to utilize the credit, nor did they return the finds in a timely manner. I had to call every week for seven weeks to receive my money back. During each call, I was told a different story. This is scribed, and included in the audio I am attaching. \\n\\nI have scribed the conversations supporting my claim, along with the recorded conversation. \\n\\nIn fact, there was a supervisor I named in my original report, XXXX who confirmed on XX/XX/XXXX I would receive my money back. You will hear XXXX on the recorded audio stating every single call is recorded. This would include hers on XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nI continued using my Barclays business credit card, and as I charged, I would pay the balance I charge in full. The interest accrued is all from the transfer that I was told should not have happened. \\n\\nThere have been several news stories, where banking facilities have taken advantage of consumers. I would like to have my interest back. I should never have had to pay it. The bank should have, after listening to all of my calls ; simply refunded this. \\n\\nI own a small business, and am completely shocked that a large banking facility would work so hard to undermine a consumer by misleading them, so they can capture interest. \\n\\nRespectfully, XXXX XXXX XXXX\"\\nI applied for a Capital One credit card around XX/XX/2019 and a message popped up saying needed further reviewing. I did receive a email letting me know the process could take up to 7-10 business days. After waiting about a week, I called the number to check the status and the automated system told me that my application is still under review. After waiting 4-5 days, I still have not heard anything. After a week, I called back and the same recording that my application is still under review. I received an email letting me know that I needed to mail or fax over my ID and social security card in which I faxed over my Driver \\'s License, Social Security Card and a copy of my new lease agreement. After waiting another week, still no response back. I then received a a letter in the mail asking me to send in a copy of my ID and social security card. Again, I faxed over these documents with my lease agreement so they could have my current address. After a few more days, I kelp calling to check the status and the same results again. Today on XX/XX/2019 I called Capital One number at XXXX and spoke with a gentleman and explained to him my concerns. He asked me for personal questions and for my social security number, date of birth and my phone number. He stated to me that, he did see my application and he does have a copy of my driver \\'s license and social security card but never mention my lease I sent in. He said after reading the notes, that there was some information that didn\\'t match and that I had to go back online to reapply. I asked him why if I\\'m going to be putting in the same information as the first time. He said, that\\'s what the system is telling him. I asked what would be different and would it be another HARD INQUIRY and he said YES it will be. I was shocked of what he was saying to me. I never heard anything from them after 15 days and I had to call just for him to tell me that information. Why did I not get a letter are via email explaining that information to me? This is unfair action and I want something done about how I have been treated. I sent everything they asked for and more by sending in my new lease agreement and now they want me to REAPPLY adding a new Inquiry on my consumer credit file. That\\'s not going to happen.\\n\"In XX/XX/2020, my account balance was {$0.00}. I responded to an ad for a balance transfer with 0 % interest and 3 % balance transfer fee. I transfered {$5000.00}.

I phoned the credit card company and they agreed that there was a problem. Somehow, even though I responded to a 0 % interest balance transfer fee offer and used the balance transfer mechanism on their website, I\\'m nonetheless being wrongfully charged interest and the balance transfer is not registered as a balance transfer on my account. \\n\\nA case was opened on XX/XX/20 and I was told it would be resolved in 1-2 business days during the regular business week.

I received only 1 of the items and spoke to Amazon, then Chase, and requested full credit for the item I did not receive. Both refused to issue the credit. \\n\\nIn addition to this fraud, of charging my credit card for something I never received, I also have been defrauded by paying for XXXX  membership associated with this card. Conditions of XXXX membership advertise that any item designated as a XXXX item is delivered within 2 days of placing the order or the item is sent without charge to the customer. This did not occur. The same delivery vendor ( XXXX  ) delivered the second item in the order but failed to deliver the main and more expensive item in the same order. It is a book by XXXX XXXX and cost {$31.00} plus tax. Since Amazon likes to hide what it charges people for tax ( another of its many frauds ), I can only estimate that it charged just under {$2.00} for the tax on this book. So I requested a credit of {$33.00} for the missing book and both Amazon and Chase refused to issue the credit. Amazon, in the typical theft it is allowed to engage in with its XXXX credit card and membership fees, wanted to offer me a {$5.00} coupon for something I never received while charging me between 6 to 7 times that amount for the phantom item. Chase told me to call again tomorrow to provide the same information. I will not do it. I gave it the information, explaining in detail why the book was not received with the rest of the same order. I should not have to repeat all of this information for yet a third time, just because Amazon and  Chase have some mutually beneficial arrangements to defraud the public.\"\\nI tried to use my account and it says it is restricted and when I called customer service, I couldn\\'t understand what the agent was saying.\\n\"I requested a credit balance refund check from CapitalOne on XX/XX/2020.

I've never in all of my years dealt with any company that penalize customers for paying off a credit card. This credit card company called XXXX does just that penalize you for paying your card off not only that they'll hold your payment when you pay with a debit card. Clearly this credit card company XXXX   would rather customers stay in debt and keep a balance instead of paying their balance off each month. Once this complaint is over and it may take a hit on my credit score but i'll surely be closing this account. \\n\\nOnXX/XX/2019 i made a payment for {$460.00} to my credit card. I made the payment well before XXXX XXXX CST/XXXX XXXX EST   so my payment should've posted at midnight yet it didn't. When i called in on XX/XX/2019 to see why my payment had not posted. I was then told by a representative name XXXX it would be on hold for 3 days. I asked him why and he continued to put the phone down when i asked. He provoked me to the point yes i became irate and asked for a supervisor. I sat on hold for 20 minutes because XXXX LIED and said i dod n't ask for one when i did. He finally got a supervisor who's name was XXXX as well. I asked this XXXX why my payment didn't post and he told me because i paid more than 50 % of my credit limit which my credit limit is {$700.00}. Then he tells me it didn't post but it will in 4 business days which this information IS NOT on their website, it's not in their terms and conditions, nor is it anywhere on their app that they will with-hold your payment if you pay too much or if you pay 50 % of your credit Limit. This makes no sense and the only time i've known for a company to with-hold a payment is when you pay by check NOT by debit card which are suppose to automatically post. Then the supervisor stated my payment didn't post because i haven't had my account opened long. This is very deceptive to customers to not have this anywhere the customers can read it or see it. \\n\\nI've included 2 screenshots. One shows the text message stating my payment had posted. The other screenshot shows the time frame for a payment to post which DOES NOT state if you pay too much they'll with-hold your payments.\", 'XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX In XX/XX/XXXX I called the Best Buy ( citibank ) Credit Card customer support to get a payoff amount, make payment and close the account. This was completed at that time, amount/payment made/closed account. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX Best Buy/citibank withdrew {$190.00} in autopay on a paid off, closed account. I called customer support immediately upon seeing this on my banks app. I was told then that it was a mistake and would be refunded within 10 days. \\n\\nNo refund was completed so I called back, asked to speak to a supervisor and was again told it would be 7-10 days. On the XX/XX/XXXX, I  received an email from Citi that the refund was being processed and should be in my account within 3 days. \\n\\nNo refund appeared within the timeframe so I called again, they gave me a account number the refund went to which was not mine, nor the account the money had been withdrawn from. After advising them of their inaccuracy and reproviding the correct account number, I asked how and why this could happen, the account had been set up on autopay and the {$190.00} they withdrew was from the same account I had just re provided. Again I was told 7-10 days.\\n\\nI called again the following week and requested to be transferred to the next level management as every answer was becoming 7-10 days.\\n\\nUpon reaching the Executive response team, they agreed that they made the mistake both by withdrawing the money to begin with but also for refunding it to \"\" some other account which was not mine \\'\\'. I was told by that team that they had another 7-10 days to review and work on the issue. \\n\\nI received a call ( the first callback during this issue ) on the XX/XX/XXXX from the executive response team stating that the only issue left was for her to get verbal confirmation from me that I did not have an account ending in XXXX ( the account they sent the money to ), I confirmed and restate here that I do not have an account ending in those numbers. Her response was that she would rush that confirmation to the \"\" other office in charge of disbursements \\'\\' and to expect the refund in my correct account within 5-7 days. \\n\\nUpon yet again not receiving the refund I called today XXXX and again spoke with my executive account specialist ( XXXX ) XXXX, she advised me she had been given bad information and that they also needed to recover the money from the erroneous account prior to paying me back for their error. \\n\\n( I would like to reiterate that even today Citi confirms they made a mistake, they know I don\\'t own the account they supposedly sent the money to, that they will not refund their mistake-my money until they get theirs back ). \\n\\nDuring this phone conversation which they record, my specialist also informed me that : 1. She now had a response date/iou to me to get back to me by XXXX. \\n2. They/Citi can\\'t/wo n\\'t as a matter of policy refund me until they secure their money first.\\n\\n3. They have no ability to find anything out about the account they sent it to as they do not know who owns it, nor can the receiving bank give out information without the account owners approval, but she has until the XXXX to get back to me, they sent the receiving bank a letter and \"\" I hope they can help \\'\\'. \\n\\nI requested to speak to the next level of management as I simply could not believe a company as large as Citi could do business in such a way. She told me the next level was the office manager but he wouldn\\'t have access to my account. I said that was fine I would still like to speak to him. She then asked me why as he had no account access? I stated he didn\\'t need to have account access, I wanted to ask him about policy. She then informed me that the office manager doesn\\'t speak to customers. I found these actions pretty telling and is what prompted me to contact Consumerfinance.gov.\\n\\nWe are currently on day 58 of this process as of XXXX and the only difference today from XX/XX/XXXX is that instead of the past 7-10 response time promised, Citi has done 2 things, one upped the time frame to 21 days and 2 advised me they won\\'t refund me until they get their money and they have no way to do that.

Best Buy stated to me that it should have been paid by XX/XX/XXXX. One day late and I am being harassed to pay them late fees now.

I was presented with a pop-up web site advertising a free sample, just pay {$5.00} shipping. I figured it was worth the risk. Well, it was not. I received a fake order, package with advertisements only and then a new {$84.00} charge. I disputed the charges and reported my card lost/stolen. Chase removed the {$5.00} charge but refuses to remove the {$84.00} charge. Chase claims I signed up for a subscription. XXXX changed their web site and offer after the sale. I have not received any product or services from XXXX and I emailed them requesting a refund about a month ago. No response! CHASE fraud services told me ... and I quote \"\" Using my credit card is as good as cash \\'\\' and \"\" once I provide my card number to a merchant I am giving them permission to charge whatever they want \\'\\' This is absurd. Top it off, the first time I called XXXX about the dispute they knew the details immediately without research. The representative was reading the \"\" terms and conditions \\'\\' of my order with XXXX. I asked them where they were reading this from and was told \"\" from their web site \\'\\' I went to the web site and it required signing in before you could read the terms and conditions. It was a completely different site from what I had seen when I ordered the free sample. How could Chase have known all the details within seconds?? Because they know the scam and protecting the scammers. \\nThe only reason I fell for this scam, after reading every minute detail and being skeptical ... was because I trusted that if it was a scam that I could simply dispute the charge. Now I see that Chase is  protecting scammers and I can no longer expect the support or protection from credit card companies.\"\\nXX/XX/2019I contact Walmart Synchrony Bank to see if my account qualified for a lower interest rate and was advised my account would be monitored periodically to see if it qualified for such reduction. I had not heard back anything from Walmart soXX/XX/2019 I decided to call again and check to see if my interest rate can be lowered due to the Federal Reserve lowering interest rates just recently and I was advised by a Rep that no it could not be lowered, I talked to Account Manager XXXX who reread the same script that I had been told in XX/XX/XXXX. This is making it extremely difficult to clear my debt with them and it\\'s unfair to consumers when the Feds lower interest rates but Walmart Synchrony Bank will not follow the same protocol, I\\'m paying XXXX bucks a month in interest alone which is beyond ridiculous, please investigate\\n\"My Capital One credit cards have been in a restricted status for over a year with no separate adverse action letter sent. I called on XX/XX/19 to find out what was going on and was finally told that my accounts were permanently restricted and Id never regain charges privileges. The representative said the great news was that I could apply for another line of credit. \\n\\nI was told that I was sent 4 emails regarding restriction notice but I keep all emails from financial institutions and although I received pat due notices, I have never received an email stating that my charging privileges would be permanently revoked or even at risk. \\n\\nCapital One is deceptive in continuing to charge membership fees on an account I will never have access to again and in failing to communicate what restricted means and how/if restricted status could be lifted.\"\\nOn XX/XX/2019, I discovered that several thousand dollars \\' worth of charges had been made on my Discover debit card. I reported them. On XX/XX/2019, I received a call from Discover dispute investigations who asked me a few questions and told me I should file a police report. I asked for the information they had and a supervisor named XXXX told me he would send me all of the documents. I never received any documents at all. On XX/XX/2019, Discover decided that the charges were valid even though it is impossible that I made them. I asked for proof and they can\\'t provide me with any proof or documents. The burden is on them to prove that I made these charges and they will not show me what they are using to justify the decision that I made them ( most likely because there is no evidence ). Now my account is overdrawn and I can not pay my bills or book necessary business travel because of this. The Deposit Agreement says I have zero liability for fraud.\\nTo whom it may concern, I am very distressed having to write this letter but I see no other way to resolve this issue. On XX/XX/XXXX I decided to get a loan to pay off my credit cards. My Barclay card was to be paid off at XXXX dollars. The bank distributed the checks to the various creditors ; I provide the statement payment stubs with the corresponding envelopes. Somehow the Barclay payment never made it were it was going. All payments were made with official bank checks. When I received my XX/XX/XXXX bill from Barclay I noticed the {$3100.00} payment was not there. I just figured it had not posted yet. When I got my XX/XX/XXXX bill and it still hadn\\'t posted I contacted my bank they retrieved the canceled check and called Barclay. The bank has faxed and emailed the canceled check to Barclay several times. Barclay finally came up with the answer that the check had gone to the wrong bank, were some of their accounts had been sold too. The bank and I have been calling Barclay Almost every week to no avail. I was told in XX/XX/XXXX when the investigation started I would not be charged late fees or interest until the matter was solved. I on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXXBarclay called 5 to 6 times I returned their called assuming they were going to tell me the problem was solved, they informed me I owed them a XXXX past due payment .I informed them as far as I was concerned they were paid off I have a canceled check made out to Barclay . We have been dealing with this since XX/XX/XXXX every time you call them you get someone different to speak too, the last supervisor I spoke to tried to get a specialist to speak to me, he was told none were available. I really need help resolving this matter ; it is putting a strain on my mental health and my marriage Thank you for your time, XXXX XXXX\\nI also found out that there is a home equity loan taken out of my name in XX/XX/2018I dont know what else\\nI was shocked when I reviewed my credit report and found 90 days late payment on the dates XX/XX/2017. I am not sure how this happened, I believe that I had made my payments to you when I received my statements. My only thought is that my monthly statement did not get to me.\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I called synchrony bank and spoke to several managers and employees and finally spoke to supposedly the highest manager XXXX employee ID XXXX. I requested a copy of my XXXX billing statement but was unable to receive a copy to this day. I had misplaced the original copy mailed to me and didnt realize it would be pure XXXX to obtain another copy otherwise I would have secured it. XXXX advised they do not email fax text or any other format other than mail will send me a copy of my billing. Also the mailed copy can only be received 7-14 business days. The issue I explained I had was I was closing on a mortgage of a home purchase and needed the documents within 3 days. I was advised they can only fed ex it to me 3-5 business days as the only other alternative. I expressed how urgently I needed my own statement but no employee nor the manager cared. He spoke with attitude and could care less about my issue. I am not asking for much just my own statement and as a creditor it should be their responsibility to provide documents quickly and efficiently. I was unable to purchase the home due to lack of this documentation. I asked for an online option through their online application but they advised because I was not previously signed up for the online billing even though I signed up on XX/XX/XXXX they still would not send me a XXXX statement. I am furious and want this to be addressed. I asked for my terms and agreement where it says they will refuse sending me documents if I need them quicker and received a letter from them with terms that I read and do not include any explanation for why they can not send it electronically to me or fed ex over one day. In fact I to this day have not received a copy of my XXXX statement. This is unacceptable! I asked how I can complain from XXXX the manager and he gave me only the address XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Utah XXXX and I sent them a letter. He had no phone number to provide.\\nMy XXXX I have had for 3 plus years and have never ever ever missed a payment and always paid in time. I have never asked for extensions and I always pay a little more than minimum due. My credit limit was {$8900.00}, which I have never been close to reaching and Barclaycard automatically went ahead and dropped it to {$6100.00}. Now they have hurt my credit report by showing my credit usage has gone extremely up and I feel that is very shady and uncalled for being that I am a long term customer and have been loyal and paid my bill on time every single month. Now my credit report is affected. I have no unpaid debts, EVERY SINGLE one of my credit cards or store cards are paid on every single month. I have a very steady job no gaps in that, no bankruptcy, no payday loans, no outstanding doctor bills even and this company does this to me. I feel this is very very wrong and at the least they should move it back to the {$8900.00} as they are causing harm to my credit report. I have reached out to them and got no response, I would like this fixed. I have attached my information from my credit report showing I am in very good standing with this company AND even shows I have never been late and pay my bills. Once this is reported in XXXX by Barclaycard they will have done major impact to my credit report and score and that is not right at all. I am at no risk not paying my bills and never have. My own bank account is never in the negative either!! This is not right at all\\nI was shocked when reviewing my credit report and found a late payment on the date below : 30 days late as of XX/XX/2020 I am not sure how this happened. I believe I made my payments to you when I received my statements. My only thought is that my statement did not get to me.\\n\"I called to the Capital One costumer service more than 4 times for my XXXX Credit Card, the third time on XX/XX/2019, which took more that 3 hours explaining the issue, finally got disconnected when I was on hold for more than 1 hour by the Costumer service Supervisor who wanted to confirm the issue with another departments. \\nOnce I didn\\'t called back again I called back on XX/XX/2019 and just informed that they put a note on my account that \"\" everything is correct. \\'\\' The issue is very simple, I explained in detail more than 10 times but it looks like there is not an intention to pay attention to my issue : Let assume today is XX/XX/2019 : I simply downloaded all of my transactions form Capital one website : 1- I summed Total ( Year to date ) posted Expenses 2- I summed Total ( Year to date ) posted Payments ( including Reward Redemption ) 3- I calculated Total ( Year to date ) Remaining Balance by extracting item 2 from Item 1.\\n\\nThe result it is showing a negative number which means I paid beyond the debts but surprisingly my available credit limit is still under the credit limit. \\nI am attaching here an transactions Excel spreadsheet which is clarifying my claim.\"\\nWhen I recently applied for a new mortgage it was discovered that my identity had been stolen and someone had opened a Nordstrom store card under my information and then purchased items, charged-off, and was sold to collections. I notified the 3 Credit Reporting Agencies and Nordstrom \\'s fraud department. The fraud department had me send a photocopy of my ID in along with a statement that the purchases were not mine and that I had not opened a card with them. I have tried to follow up several times with the Fraud department and each time they repeat that they have been sending physical mail which I am not receiving. They have also claimed I will need to work with the collections company separately. The issue is Nordstrom is the party responsible for not performing due diligence and issuing fraudulent credit and then selling that fraudulent credit to a 3rd party.  Nordstrom should be responsible AND helpful in the process. My credit report shows all paid as agreed ( never a single delinquency ) prior to this fraud. I would also expect them to be able to pull the location the card was opened such as physical store or IP address to show it was not me.\\n\"Discover card advertized promotional rates and I applied. Got approved for {$4500.00} credit line. They run my credit which is excellent. I got email \"\" congratulations, you card is in the mail \\'\\', than I received completely fraudulent request for my tax returns release from XXXX. I called Discover and they explained that they just implemented brand new policy of requesting tax reutrns AFTER they approve credit card. This policy is complete fraud. After all those security breaches at XXXX, XXXX, Credit Card acompanies and banks, you got to be completely insane to release your taxes to them. \\nMost importantly, Discover DID NOT DSCLOSE PRIOR TO applying and running my hard credit check that they will be requiring my tax returns release. if they had disclosed prior to taking my application that they have new policy of requesting release of consumer \\'s tax returns thru recently hacked Equifax, I would have never applied. I requested they remove the credit check from my credit reports and they refused. I beleive this practice is FRAUDULENT.\"\\nOn XX/XX/2019, I learned a credit account had been opened in my name at Barclays Bank. The card had an outstanding balance of {$15000.00}. I called Barclays Bank to notify them of the fraudulent account and was told they would investigate. I completed an Identity Theft Report at the Federal Trade Commission website. I printed the report, sent it to Barclays along with a letter requesting the account be closed and reported as fraudulent to the credit bureaus. I froze my credit report at all 3 credit bureaus and mailed them the identity theft report along with a request the account be removed from my credit report. On XX/XX/2019 I filed a incident report at my local police precinct and a police report was issued. I faxed the police report to Barclays on XX/XX/2019, then followed up with a phone to Barclays on XX/XX/2019. When I called I gave the representative the name and contact information for the Detective assigned to the case. As a result of the Detective \\'s investigation an arrest warrant was issued, an arrest made, and a guilty plea entered in court. The guilty plea was entered on XX/XX/2019. On XX/XX/2019, Barclays called me to inform me they had completed their investigation and determined the account was valid. On XX/XX/2019, I faxed additional documentation to Barclays, including a letter for the US District Attorney \\'s office documenting the guilty plea on the charge of credit card fraud. On XX/XX/2019, I called Barclays to follow up, according to the representative, the documentation faxed XX/XX/2019 had not been reviewed, but would be forwarded to the investigations team. The account remains under review. Over the last 3 months, I have received 2 letters from Barclays stating their investigation was complete and the account is valid. I have spoken with multiple representative who claim that purchases made with the card, including groceries, were household items and therefore I am responsible for the account. Every time I call Barclays, I am place on hold multiple times, transferred at least twice or asked to call back at another number. When I call, I never speak to the same representative more than once.\\nI have a military star card with an unknown minimum payment. This account has been open since XXXX of XXXX. I pay the full, or at least half of the statement balance each month through the mobile app. A late payment remark was put on my credit report in XXXX of XXXX. Im positive I payed on time and believe it was an issue with the mobile app processing my payment slowly.\\n\"On XX/XX/XXXX I noticed 11 different charges of {$8.00}, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX etc ... I immediately called Regions Bank because I noticed fraudulent activity on my account. I was told that since these charges were pending, I had to wait until the charges were approved in order to file a dispute. I then cancelled my debit card and ordered another card because I was not familiar with the charges. I knew I had been scammed! I then called Regions Bank and filed a complaint. While filing the complaint, I was told that I would be contacted within 10 days on a decision concerning the claim. After several weeks on receiving no answer, I called Regions and I was informed that I would not be receiving a refund because they deemed the charges authorized from the account holder. I vehemently disagreed with them and tried to resolve this issue. Those particular funds were sent to a \"\" XXXX XXXX \\'\\' of which I do not own. There are a total of 11 consecutive charges on my debit card which is in itself suspicious. I would like these funds returned to me because I did not give any authorization to anyone whatsoever to charge me over and over of XXXX dollars! I was obviously scammed and Regions Bank is failing to see this. Again, I made no such purchases, neither did I give anyone permission to charge my card over and over for {$8.00}. Why would I then contact Regions immediately when I saw suspicious activity.\"\\nI was a victim of identity theft between the timeframe of XXXX a gentleman by the name of XXXX XXXX stole my identity and my father as well and opened fraudulent accounts like auto loans, credit cards, and business credit cards as well. One particular account I found was Discover Bank I contacted them and sent them a police report and tried to resolve this matter with them and they refuse to believe me I want to disputed with the credit bureau sent in my police report and everything needed to prove this account was fraud according to Discover Bank I recently received a letter stating that they didnt believe me and they were going to put a new account under my name that I did not authorize or I never applied for again this account was never applied by myself I was a victim of identity theft\\nI was a victim of identity theft. I did not open credit card and notified company of that. The account should have been closed of further use. Instead I was hit with a lawsuit.\\n\"I authorized payment for my Chase Account on XX/XX/2019 for my Credit Card that is due on on XX/XX/2019 ( the day my account payment is due ). On XX/XX/2019 Chase Bank ignored the fact I set up a payment and instead autozied credit card payment using the automatic payment I had set up in case I forgot to pay my bill. Then two days later on XX/XX/2019 ( after my credit card statement was due, they authorized the payment I had scheduled on XX/XX/2019 this lead to my account with XXXX XXXX XXXX. \\n\\nWe went in and got a refund from Chase bank, and XXXX XXXX refunded my overdraft. But I wanted to make someone aware that Chase bank withheld payment that I scheduled for my credit card until after my Due due.\"\\nThe merchant used abusively  and fraudulently my credit card information both on its terminal and to pay his own bills. It has been 9 months since I\\'m trying to resolve the issue both with the merchant and Amex. I never swiped or authorized in a verbal or written manner any charge to my account neither I own any amount to this merchant. The merchant never produced any valid documentation.\\nCitibank has recently closed my credit card accounts\\n\"In XXXX I lost a credit card and had to cancel it once I realized it was missing, i only realized this because it was used and I didn\\'t use it. I had also applied for a new license which I never received in the mail and had to go back to the dmv to reapply and than In late XX/XX/2019 I realized I was a victim of Identity fraud. I didn\\'t realize this till logging onto my credit score with XXXX XXXX. I saw new remarks and credit cards that I did not apply for ... some showing in early to Mid XXXX, I did as the app said to contact the credit bureaus. After placing fraud alerts on my accounts I decided then to put a freeze on all 3 credit bureaus early XXXX, when more accounts started to show on my credit report. This continued to happen again thou, another 3 accounts showed up ... I was told that there wasn\\'t a time limit on when they would register to show to my credit page, it was possible it was done before the freeze and I should once again take the appropriate steps. So I did, but the last of these creditors that showed was Conn \\'s dba Conn \\'s appliance inc. I contacted the bureaus first as I did with every situation that arose during this time and than reached out to the actual creditor. This time trying to reach a representative seemed more difficult. But after a few days I got a hold of a customer service rep who said that the fraud dept was closed but she could note my account and someone would contact me. This never happened so I tried again, this time though I had an actual notice in the mail from this company, I used this information to finally get in touch with Conn \\'s, I finally got transferred to the fraud dept of this creditor. Shortly after I received an email from this department stating what I needed to do next for this claim. Within 36 hrs I had filled out there paperwork had it notarized and went to XXXX to fill out a police report. Some weeks had passed by so I used the email information to contact them back, the rep said my claim was still pending but should be processed by the end of the week. It was not, before I could contact them again the XXXX called me to see if the situation had be rectified and it had not. So I reached back out again but this time I was told a letter of my status to the claim was mailed to me the week before. I never received it. So they sent it to me via email. And I felt devastated and violated all over again. Conn \\'s appliance Inc dba Conn \\'s denied my claim.  and the reason they denied my claim made no sense to me. They denied it with the very definition of what identity theft means. \\nThey said \"\" Name, DOB, DL number, expiration date, address and signature on the DL provided with the fraud affidavit and the DL used to open the account matched. Signed by XXXX XXXX Fraud Investigator-Conn \\'s Home Plus. \\nI quickly responded to the email that I wanted to appeal this claim, but got no response. I tried contacting the number on the letter but the recording said it couldn\\'t help me at this time and quickly disconnected me. \\nI tried emailing again this morning and haven\\'t received a response yet again. I than tried the phone number again this morning and got a voice mail. \\nThis account was open without my knowledge or permission or consent. \\nI\\'am a VICTIM of identity theft.', 'On XX/XX/21 my XXXX XXXX XXXX balance was PAID IN FULL online. On XX/XX/21, a {$2.00} \"\" interest charge \\'\\' was charged on a ZERO balance, which is arbitrary and fraudulent. This charge was discovered on XXXX thanks to credit reporting apps showing my payment was \"\" late \\'\\'. I immediately paid fraudulent interest and disputed via customer service call with XXXX XXXX XXXX. The money was refunded/reversed to me but there is still a derogatory remark on my credit. Me and my mortgage company received a letter refusing my dispute.', 'In XX/XX/XXXXto XX/XX/2019 statement Payments were made in full, less new purchases. In XX/XX/XXXXto XX/XX/XXXXstatement Balance was paid in full on XX/XX/2019. Payment due date was XX/XX/2019. XXXX A National holiday ) Actual payment was made on XX/XX/2019, but due to holiday, not processed thru Bank of Americas website until XX/XX/2019. Then posted in XX/XX/2019. Next statement I was charged {$6.00} interest. Before that I was charged {$8.00} in interest in XX/XX/XXXX. I called Customer service and after a 30 minute hold with computer held messages, I was finally transferred to live operator XXXX. Upon explaining my request to return {$8.00} from XX/XX/XXXX, and {$6.00} from XX/XX/XXXXin interest charged, She explained their policy is that I would need to pay the full balance for two months straight to avoid interest. I explained that was wrong, she then put me on hold, and returned with the answer that I was late on payment which was due on XX/XX/2019. I again explained payment was paid on XX/XX/2019 and not processed until XX/XX/XXXX and posted on XX/XX/2019. She stated they were open 24 hours a day and the interest charge for both months will remain. \\nI feel BOA is charging interest on accounts who pay in full, fraudulently and want to report them for manipulating dates and payments. I also am demanding return of {$14.00} taken as interest payment which if I did not pay, would result in late fees and negative credit reporting.\"\\nMy YSA Flexible Spending card was stolen on XX/XX/XXXX. I didn\\'t realize it was stolen until about a week later. I called and requested a new card, and the agent did not go over the transactions pending on the account, so I had no idea there was an unauthorized charge. The charge was done on XX/XX/XXXX for {$8.00} at XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX, FL. ( Yes, the charge is at a key-making kiosk ... pretty sure their MCC code has nothing to do with medical services or products, so it should have never been approved in the first place. ) On XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed I\\'d received a notice to provide documentation for a pending claim from YSA. On that day, I provided the first notice ( attached as Flex Card Stolen.pdf ) that the card in question was unauthorized. Per Regulation E, YSA had 10 business days from that date to provide provisional credit and begin their investigation. I then received another notice on XX/XX/XXXX that the information provided was insufficient and I needed to provide receipts and documentation to prove the eligibility of the charge. At that time I contacted the company via phone and made another claim of fraud. They claimed I needed to fill out a form ; however, on the form they said I needed to fill it, it clearly states that instead of the form, I can provide them with a written explanation of the nature of my dispute. As such, I again provided a more detailed notice on that date ( XX/XX/XXXX ) detailing the unauthorized nature of the transaction. I have again received the same vague notice on XX/XX/XXXX that more information is required. As such, I have filled out their form and uploaded it to the site. Since the transaction is unauthorized, there is no other information I can provide. I find this process to be unnecessarily burdensome ( quite frankly ridiculous, just like every interaction with Your Spending Account ) and in violation of my rights under Regulation E.\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I was working at XXXX XXXX XXXX doing a laundry reset. ( i did make a purchase there for XXXX ) My phone was charging in the car so I went to go get it and noticed I had several notifications from Chase asking if I made a purchase at a gas station for XXXX. I immediately said no I called them and replied to the email. Informing them that I did not make this transaction they cancelled my card and started a claim and credited the money back the following day. XX/XX/XXXX I recieved a letter saying that they deemed the transaction authorized. And that on XX/XX/XXXX they will take the funds back out of my account. I immediately called them and the rep told me that because I could have done it because I was in the vincity of that location. I told him that from where I was it was a good XXXX minutes away and that it wasn\\'t me. I asked if I could send proof like pictures. He said say yes. So I did. I went back to the store took pictures and recorded myself in their computer of me working, it shows my in the laundry aisle working at the time the transaction happened. Their was no way to send the video so I sent pictures. Waited about a week and half to see if they recieved it, I even called about 3 times different days to see if they got it. After they recieved it I waited about a day and called them back, he said that it was declined again. I asked why he said because I had previous history with the merchant. I advise him that I rarely if ever go to that XXXX and I havent gotten gas from them in awhile, I spoke to someone higher and all she said was the claim was denied, their is nothing they can do. I refused to give up so I contacted XXXX XX/XX/XXXX to try and get this resolved he ( XXXX XXXX ) told me to give him a couple days I waited a week so I called back he then told me to file a police report becuSe he cant look at the cameras unless he has a report. So today XX/XX/XXXX I got one I sent it to him he then messages me back 20 minutes later saying that they don\\'t have any footage and that XXXX is unable to assist. I have tried everything and anything and I dont feel like Chase is being fair, they didnt look up proof or even try they just looked at history ad was like no she csnt get her money back. I work to hard I have 3 jobs and this is a problem. I own a car it takes roughly about XXXX XXXX to fill up\\n\"Dear Sir or Madam. \\n\\nMy XXXX and I are both XXXX XXXX XXXX.

The last charges were made in XX/XX/2018, the same month we left XXXX. We made no new charges after that date. I didn\\'t receive any calls, emails, bills or notifications until I got a message from a credit monitoring service about a change in my credit report.

To the best of my knowledge, I was given no option to select this debt protection fee - as I would, say, an extended warranty - at the time of purchase. I was only made aware of this due to a discrepancy between the outstanding total on the Best Buy credit card site and the You Need A Budget app I was trying to sync it with, which led to my being made aware of this to begin with. \\n\\nThis fee shows up in my statement as \"\" XXXX, \\'\\' and after a brief phone call with Best Buy this morning I was able to opt out.

I own 2 chase credit cards and I use the checking account to deposit my paychecks every two weeks since past 1 year now.

After being on the call for about 3 hours, we get to learn that someone from the fraud department marked the transaction as fraud and it was then cancelled. Firstly, I never reported the transaction as fraud and I didn\\'t receive any message/call/notification about this from the bank, asking me whether I made the transaction or not. Secondly, I didn\\'t even receive any refund back for 2 months until I called and asked them about it. There was no way for me to know about this incident, except the day before boarding the flight. I had no other option than to book another flight which of course was at a much higher price of {$2200.00}. \\n\\nSo, after 3 months since I first booked the ticket and many long hours of back and forth calls between the 2 departments, I finally did get the {$1400.00} back as a refund, which I appreciate. But I really feel that none of this was my mistake as a transaction was cancelled without even my consent or letting me know in advance. So why should I be bearing a loss of {$800.00}? I don\\'t think it\\'s right to just cancel transactions from a card by marking them fraud without first talking to the customer about it. \\n\\nI e-mailed the same to the CEO, Mr. XXXX XXXX, on XX/XX/XXXX and received a call back from his department. After reviewing my case and going through the details, I was refused any compensation saying that the bank has the right to cancel any transaction they want, whenever they want. This makes me feel less reliable on Chase credit cards now and I feel it\\'s not the right way to treat the customers. I already cancelled one of the card and stopped depositing my paychecks.

The bureaus reported back within several weeks that they were regarding this account as valid, but I have not received any proof as to the validity of the account. Specifically, XXXX  has it listed in their latest report to me that investigation complete-reported by data furnished. Capital One reports the account in such a manner yet demonstrated that the investigation, was in fact not complete in the sense of their subsequent mailing to me directly. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Capital One requesting that I provide them with information regarding the nature of my dispute. My demand was straightforward, proof the validity of this account, the basis that it is being furnished to the credit bureaus and verify it by the manner that a holder of the right to furnish that information should, signed valid contract, chain of assignments of any holders of the alleged account and a sum certain accounting of the amount of the account, including all fees and interest. They appear to be either unable or unwilling to provide this information and if they can not prove this account, what right does Capital One have to put this information on my credit report in the first place? \\n\\nApparently they have told the three credit bureaus that the account was valid as listed yet write me asking for information pertaining to the account, showing no proof as to the positive existence of this account yet requesting information of me regarding how the account is showing on my credit reports. They should know this since they are furnishing the information and if they can not confirm that information they are placing there is correct then they should remove that information. I am familiar with the Unfair, Deceptive, Abusive Acts or Practices part of the Dodd-Frank Bill. This should certainly apply in how this company is conducting its business here. If they can not prove the validity, of this account, if it is unverifiable, they should delete it. They are violating the law otherwise. Also, along the lines of the XXXX, the account is listed as being charged-off back in XXXX, yet in XXXX they added another {$160.00} on what strongly appears to be another violation. And they list a credit limit of {$8600.00} to an account that is allegedly closed and have it listed on a couple of my credit reports at 73 % usage. I would imagine if the account was actually closed and subsequently charged-off the term usage in this matter would fall under being a deceptive act.\"\\nOn XX/XX/, 2019 I had received a notification my credit score had gone down which I am in the process of purchasing a home and can not have it go down, so I logged online to see the reason it had gone down and the notification stated I had one of my credit cards maxed out to be specific my JCPenny Store Credit Card maxed out. I was confused and thought to myself this is clearly fraud because I dont have my JCPenny Credit Card maxed out and the notification continued to say make a payment and bring the balance down to bring your credit score back up. I immediately called JCPenny customer service XXXX at XXXX central standard time on XX/XX/, 2019. I explain to the customer service representative that it shows me maxed out on my credit card and this is wrong and clearly fraud and she stated it was correct that they changed my credit limit to {$280.00}. I asked her on what grounds did they change it and this is deceptive business practices because they did not inform me that they had changed it or why, that I received not notification whatsoever. I told her that as a consumer who agreed to a certain amount when I initially applied for the card a year ago and allowed them to run my credit a year ago and was approved for {$500.00} that this has been my a credit amount this entire time. I told her I have never paid late or gone over my credit limit. The representative said that is correct you were approved for {$500.00} about a year ago and never paid late and said however we have a system that monitors your spending habits and will match your credit line to your spending habits, so I tell the representative okay let me make sense of what you are saying and said since I dont max out my card or use the {$500.00} every month your system is monitoring my spending habits and your system changed my credit limit to match my actual spending amount and she said yes. I tell the representative again this is deceptive business practices to monitor my spending or any consumers spending and based on those grounds they changed my credit limit and thats where I have an issue because it was changed without my knowledge and this hurt my credit score. I told her because you monitored my spending and changed my limit to what I actually spend which is roughly {$280.00} a month and me having a balance of {$270.00} has a negative impact on me and this information reports to credit bureau as a card maxed out and to make a payment to bring balance down and this would then raise your credit score and thats where I have a problem and issue with these deceptive business practices. This company completed deceptive business practices by monitoring my spending but to change my credit limit based on spending habits and not inform the consumer is deceptive and wrong. The representative apologizes and says we can raise it again but to raise a credit limit we have to run your credit report again which I declined and told her why would I run my credit report again to have the same limit I initially started with. I told her I gave you permission to run it a year ago and agreed to a certain amount and for what for you to monitor my spending and just change it. I informed her I was gon na file a complaint because they did not notify me in any way, shape or form and if it was not because of my alert from credit bureaus that there had been a change to credit score I would never have known the amount changed. I told her I could have decided to purchase something for someone as a gift and my card would have been declined and again she apologizes and says lets run your credit score again to raise it back up for you. This has been the most deceptive act I have ever come across, for your spending habits to be monitored and your credit line changed based on those grounds.\\nA few months ago I had a dip in my credit score which Caused Bank of America to make the decision to close my Credit Card account that I help with them.

The ad showed and specified that they worked on any surface, carpet etc. When I got them, they did not work. I immediately asked for a prepaid return label to return them. They could have been damaged in delivery or defective but its probably just a dishonest company pulling a scam and using USPS to do it. I then informed PayPal that I refused to pay the charge or the s & h and requested them to recourse it back to the merchant. If the merchant would like to sue me they are more than welcome. If they want the merchandise returned, then they will have to send a prepaid return address label. I have called PayPal numerous times and been transferred to all their departments from PayPal credit to resolutions and back again and to various managers. Thus far they have refused to recourse the charges back to the merchant as I requested. I refuse to pay the charge and have made that clear since I received it. My understanding is that I have that right with any credit card charge. Please help. \\nThank you for your time.\"\\nMy Chase Visa card XXXX had a fraudulent charge of {$190.00} from XXXX XXXX XXXX on XXXX-2019. I reported it to Chase and Chase falsely claimed to investigate the charge but refused to correct it. I paid the balance due and Chase closed the account. The merchant later corrected the fraudulent charge and credited the {$190.00} to my closed Visa account. The closed account now has a credit balance but Chase has not refunded the credit balance to me.\\n\"On XX/XX/XXXX of 2021 I discovered that my XXXX Rewards Visa Account with JP Morgan Chase had been closed without warning or explanation. At this time there had never been a single late or missed payment on this account and no payment was even due. Upon calling JP Morgan Chase believing this to be a mistake I was informed that the department I needed to speak to was closed and due to the holiday weekend I would have to wait until Tuesday. \\n\\nUpon contacting the number provided I explained what had happened to the employee at JP Morgan Chase who seemed to be just as baffled as confused as I was and agreed that they did not understand it as well and asked me to bear with them several times as they continued to search through my account trying to discover why this had happened. The employee eventually said that they found the reason for the closure of my account and that it was in a letter and then asked if I had gotten the letter to which I had not and told him this. \\n\\nThe employee working for JP Morgan Chase proceeded to tell me that Chase had received a letter from XXXX ( whom I had a paid credit monitoring service through at the time ) sent them a letter ordering them to close my account. I was so confused I didnt even know what to think and asked several questions including how XXXX had the power to close my account to which he said he did not know, what contact information was included in the letter to which he claimed he was unable to share, if I could have a copy of the letter to which he refused, and what I needed to do next to which he said I had to contact XXXX to resolve the issue because they are the ones that closed my account. \\n\\nAfter speaking to multiple departments of XXXX over the next several days there was not a single employee who had ever heard of such a thing and told me very boldy that I had been lied to. This led me to believe that some kind of fraud or identity theft had taken place and no matter who I talked to at JP Morgan Chase NOBODY would help me or give me ANY kind of information. \\n\\nThis put me in a state of fear and terrified to use kind of debit or credit cards at this point so I locked everything and froze my credit report until I could get some answers. These were answers that never came. Instead all I have received from JP Morgan Chase and its employees have been lies that caused an immense amount of damage not only to my credit report, my means of living, ability to pay bills and try to survive through the pandemic the world is suffering through, but most importantly my own well being. \\n\\nI made dozens of attempts to contact JP Morgan Chase between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX all of which ended with me either being transferred to a dead line, hung up on, or my favorite of being re assured I was being transferred to an actual person in a department that would only be a recorded message and then hang up on me. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I had an alert that a payment did not go through to JP Morgan Chase. At this time I chose to use their online secured message feature to contact them in regards to it and much to surprise I actually received an answer so I decided to use this form of communication in regards to my closed account. \\n\\nAfter more than a dozen messages have been exchanged I have been given multiple phone numbers to contact during specific business hours ( all of which have led straight to a recording that says they are closed and hangs up during the times given ), and been told that my inquiry has been escalated to a manager, been notified that this has been sent an investigator to determine a resolution. \\n\\nNone of these things have happened. The only contact Chase has made with me has been automated phone calls and when transferred to a live person they dont have any clue what I am even referring to. I have not received a single email from an individual, a letter in the mail, a phone call or any form of contact from an investigator, or had a single person leave a message saying they were trying to get in contact with me. \\n\\nI believe this to be very unacceptable from the very beginning when their employee lied to me about the reason for the closure of my account all the way up until now where it has been more than 2 months and I still have not received any truth from JP Morgan Chase. \\n\\nIn fact all that I have received from this company is an immense amount of damage to my life as a direct result of the actions of JP Morgan Chase and their employees, extensive damage to my credit history and report, multiple financial hardships directly related to this entire situation that they have refused to resolve or even take interest in, and my own mental well-being that has been severely affected by this entire situation caused by JP Morgan Chase and its employees. \\n\\n[ Electronic Messages Exchanged Are Attached ]', 'Netspend Fraud - XX/XX/2020 ( XXXX XXXX ) I believe I am a victim of fraud by Netspend or by people creating fraudulent Netspend credit card accounts under my name. I need help resolving this issue as all my attempts to do so through the company have been unsuccessful. Please provide guidance to me. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/2020, I got four emails in a row starting around XXXX ET, over the course of 5 minutes, from noreply@netspend.com. The emails were NOT encrypted ( seems very unusual for such emails ) and each contained a security code, like someone was trying to reset a password or enter an account fraudulently. I had previously never heard of Netspend. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/2020, I went online ( https : //www.netspend.com/help/contact/ ) and called Netspend to look into the situation and try to put an end to any fraudulent activity, which I was very concerned about. Before being able to talk with a customer service representative, the automated phone options ( XXXX ) force you to enter either a Netspend account number or your full social security number. I dont have any account with Netspend and I was calling to close any possible fraudulent account, and there was no way I was going to give over my full social security number given my concerns. \\n\\nUnable to reach a customer service representative on the phone, I emailed one of Netspends supposed fraud complaint emails ( spoof@netspend.com ) writing them : I never applied for this card, do not want a card, and believe this represents fraud. It needs to be investigated and the account closed immediately.\\n\\nI tried calling your phone number, but there is no way to reach someone if you don\\'t have an account ( or maybe even if you do ). Unbelievable.\\n\\nThere was no response from Netspend. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/2020, I got an email at XXXX XXXX ET from card@email.netspend.com stating that Your Netspend card is on the way, although I never requested a card nor would I ever request one with Netspend. The email stated that my Netspend Visa Prepaid Card has been shipped and is on its way to you. Once your card arrives, be sure to activate it and verify your identity. * After that, add money to your Card Account and then use your card to buy groceries, pay bills,1 and shop online! \\n\\nI got similar emails from Netspend on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from Netspend stating : thank you for requesting your new Netspend Visa Prepaid Card. Don\\'t forget to activate your Card Account and verify your identity! \\n\\nI noticed that the different emails from Netspend included information stating my email address ( although written differently than I typically type it ) as well as the last digits of the supposed prepaid card. However, some emails included four digits, while other emails included just three digits. \\n\\nOn the morning of XX/XX/XXXX, I spent an hour on the phone between XXXX and XXXX trying to reach a customer representative at the customer service number. I entered digits for a social security code ( although I made them up ) when faced with the automated phone system requiring a social security number. Then, after waiting for 10 minutes, I finally reached a representative who immediate started saying she couldnt hear me. I said I could hear her and that I was calling to look into a problem, but she continued to talk over me and then returned me to the automated phone system again.\\n\\nI called back and used the same method to get to another representative. Again, they asked how they could help me, then subsequently said, If you can hear me caller, please respond. I said I could hear him and asked if he could hear me and that I was calling to report a problem, but he kept repeating the same thing over and over several times, like from a script. And then the line went dead and I was in silence. \\n\\nBoth interactions seemed very contrived. I believe they could, in fact, hear me and that his was just part of the scam. I have never had any audio issue with my phone and successfully made and received calls with other callers the same day without any audio issues. \\n\\nAfter my frustrating phone calls with Netspend, I then wrote an email at XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX to the XXXX  of Netspend ( XXXX ), and email address that is posted at https : //www.netspend.com/help/contact/ for complaints or compliments. In my email I wrote again that I had never applied for a card, did not want a card, and that I felt this represented fraud and that it needed to be investigated and the account closed immediately. I reported that I had tried to call severals times, but that I had encountered the problems described above with the automated phone system asking for impossible or sensitive information, and then representatives who appeared to be pretending not to hear me while reading from a script. At the end of my email, I wrote that I planned to submit complaints to the Consumer Protection Bureau, the Better Business Bureau, and perhaps law enforcement.\\n\\nI received an automated reply from donotreply@netspend.com at XXXX stating : Thank you for contacting the Netspend Corporate Office . Your concern is important to us and one of our analysts will respond to you within three business days.\\n\\nWe are closely monitoring the latest news about the current global emergency. We are open, but are currently experiencing extended wait times to speak with our customer service agents. We strongly encourage you to use our digital tools such as your Netspend Mobile App and website ( located on the back of your card ) for self-service banking and convenient account access. \\n\\nAdditionally, to help ensure you receive the best service experience during this time, our Customer Service hours have temporarily changed to Monday through Friday XXXX CST and Saturday through Sunday XXXX CST. \\n\\nThank you, Netspend Corporate Office I highly doubt that I will receive any further response. The whole situation has been outrageous.\"\\nI was pinned with several late payments up to 90days ... Capital One Never Sent my Billing Statements To The Correct Address. Ive tried to dispute this with them several times and they refused to do anything about it. If anyone take a close and careful look at my payment history with this company or any other company on my credit profile Ive never been late or missed a payment. The statements was being sent to an address I had no association with. They have me paying on time with XXXX in the month of XX/XX/XXXX but 30 days with the XXXX and XXXX. Then 30 days late with XXXX in the month of XX/XX/XXXX but in the same month 60days late with the XXXX and XXXX. 60 days late with XXXX in the month XX/XX/XXXX but 90 days late with with the XXXX   and XXXX. In the month XX/XX/XXXX XXXX 90days late but now we have on time payments with the XXXX and XXXX. So as you can see the information have been reported incorrectly the entire time they was sending the billing statements to wrong address. Now they want me to pay the price for they mistakes ... All I want is for the all the late payments to be removed. For a loyal customer since XX/XX/XXXX with no late payments ever. I feel that them making a an adjustment to correct the late payment will be very satisfying to a loyal customer. All late payments should be removed immediately. Reporting inaccurate information is terms for deletion according to FCRA.\\nOn XX/XX/2019, I returned from overseas, to find my Comenity Capital Bank Mastercard was missing. I immediately checked my account online to find that charges totaling {$640.00} had been made, primarily to an XXXX online store for {$380.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, {$160.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. I advised Comenity that I was reporting fraud, the card was cancelled and a new one issued. My notification to them was on XX/XX/XXXX and yet my statement reflects an XXXX charge on XX/XX/XXXX. When I called Comenity on XX/XX/XXXX, I was told that I did not need to call XXXX as they would do it as part of the investigation. I received a letter from them on XX/XX/XXXX stating that my fraud claim is denied as they can find no basis to support my claim. That was the extent of their explanation, except to add that the more than {$600.00} in charges would be put back on my account. I called XXXX after receiving the letter. There were 3 credit card numbers issued to me before and after this fraud occurred. XXXX looked under all three credit card numbers, under my email address, and could find no order number, no tracking number and my email was not in their system. I had looked through all my emails-no record there. XXXX told me that the credit card company should be able to track the charges made, but I received no explanation that they had done so. I appears that there was no investigation. XXXX had no record of speaking to Comenity. Comenity never called me to follow up, other than the form letter they sent. I called the  number they gave me if I have any questions regarding the investigation, and after waiting on hold for 15 minutes, I began to discuss this with the representative that answered, and the phone connection was cut. I have laid all of this out in a letter to the company, sent to the address they directed in their letter. I also advised them that I was contacting you as this seems to me to be suspect. What kind of company sends a form letter that tells the victim of fraud no details of what they base a decision like this on. Either I was defrauded or I am committing fraud. Without anything to justify their position that I owe this money, I have appealed their decision.\\n\"CHASE Card Services closed my Account arguing DELINQUENCY OR DEROGATORY STATUS ON ACCOUNT WITH US. Because my Credit history and reports are impeccable, I do believe this was in reprisal for cancelling my wife \\'s and myself application for new VISA Cards. Such cards were suggested by MARRIOT Vacation Club agents ( BonVoy  ) to gain points in the BonVoy Program that we also cancelled as explained below. \\n\\nThe facts are as follows : 1. We ( My wife and I ) have hold a British Airways VISA card for the last 8 years. Since then, we have paid all our monthly balances in full and on time. The same is true for all and any of the credit cards that we currently have including CITI MasterCard, XXXX XXXX , XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  VISA ( Debit ), XXXX XXXX VISA ( Debit ). \\n\\n2. Our current credit score is XXXX, and we do not have any derogatory or delinquent items as the Chase letter suggests. \\n\\n3. In the last week of XX/XX/2019, we purchased a new Marriot Vacation Plan (  BonVoy ) costing about {$45000.00}. The selling agent suggested to us to apply for individual Marriot VISA cards to \"\" gain \\'\\' points that could be used to pay for vacations later. However, on XX/XX/2019, after testing the product and verifying that benefits described to us were not accurate, we decided to both cancelling purchase of the Plan and  withdrawing application for new VISA cards. \\n\\n4. On XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX we unsuccessfully tried to use out VISA cards, and on XX/XX/XXXX we received an unsigned notification stating that because of DELINQUENCY OR DEROGATORY STATUS ON ACCOUNT WITH US, CHASE has closed our Credit Card account. Although I called the credit card customer services, they stated that they could not give us any information because that was a decision made by CHASE. \\n\\n5. Since our Credit Card record is impeccable, and we do not have and haven\\'t had any delinquent or derogatory items ever with this or any other credit card or any other organization, I have concluded that the CHASE action against us was taken in reprisal for cancelling our applications for new cards that were suggested by Marriot. \\n\\n6. CHASE action resulted in embarrassing situations to my wife and myself when we were trying to pay for items we have purchased and CHASE denied payment without prior notice and subsequent refusal to provide us an explanation and identifying specific reason for their action.', 'They claim I activated an XXXX Rate Sale offer with a promotional rate through XX/XX/22.

I called and spoke to one of their representatives and asked if I could set up an automatic transfer from my savings to my credit card account to keep the account open, she said yes that would be acceptable. Once that payment date arrived the account had been closed out anyway. I attempted to speak to USAA about the issue and it took 3 phone calls to finally get to someone who was able to help. She was a member of the ceo relations team. She reviewed the phone calls and got back to me. She did acknowledge the fault lay with USAA and she would find a way to fix the issue. Over the next 2.5-3 months I didnt hear anything back. I attempted to contact her multiple times and was never able to get ahold of her. On one occasion I was on the phone for 45 minutes before someone could transfer me to the correct department. As they transferred me the call dropped and I never got a call back. I finally heard back from her last week and was told that they could reopen the card. I called yesterday and told her Id be able to open the account with a {$500.00} deposit, was told that wasnt a problem. She called back this morning and said first that they couldnt open the account with {$500.00} only {$300.00} since that was the line of credit originally. Later in this same phone call she said they werent willing to open the credit line with {$500.00}. It seems like they arent really trying to correct their mistake and dont want to do what seems appropriate to make the situation right.\\nOk so I deposited my work check of a total of XXXX , and I dont know exactly where that money went at all I wanted to know where all of that money went that I deposited into my account. When I try to cash my check again it isnt letting me at all.

I asked them that\\'s it\\'s your mistake since no one took my call when I tried for whole night for at least 4-5 hours. \\nThey said, since we can not cancel the ticket after 24 hours of booking, but I asked them that at least someone should have taken my grievance that time, and I was asking for re-schedule also for at least the return flight cost rather than the whole flight. But since no one picked up the call whole night they are putting this cost to my account and forcing me to pay. \\nNeed help in such case. \\nRegards XXXX\"\\nHad a negative balance on card, they couldn\\'t tell the difference between and negative or positive balance they charged me {$25.00} overdraft twice even though nothing was owed. They refunded half of the charges but still another {$25.00} was charged. They never correct it.\\n\"In XX/XX/XXXX I purchased a vacation for my XXXX birthday for my mom, sister and myself. I charged my mom and sister \\'s vacation on a XXXX card. I purchased my vacation on the Citibank card. I booked the vacation through Cheap XXXX. When we arrived to our vacation spot the hotel recommended by XXXX XXXX was an all-inclusive resort which was supposed to include the following but not limited to, non-motorized water sports, daily activities, nightly live shows and entertainment. \\nThe first evening our room did not have electricity for two nights and the \"\" all-inclusive \\'\\' resort did not have the amenities that it was claimed to provide. I attempted to work with the merchant and the hotel and their recommendations were not acceptable to me. \\n\\nUpon my return from the vacation, I disputed the charges with XXXX and Citibank. XXXX was able to recover the disputed amounts and Citibank responded on the last week of XX/XX/XXXX that they were not able to recover the disputed charge of approximately {$360.00}. \\n\\nI had called Citibank to discuss their decision and after speaking with a variety of associates at Citibank they told me that I did not accept the merchant \\'s suggestion to move to another resort. XXXX XXXX of Citibank told me her position was with the Executive Response Unit of the President of Citibank. She actually insinuated that I should have moved to another resort. Ultimately, the associates of Citibank should not discuss what options I should have taken and Citibank should have handled recovering the disputed amount with the merchant because what was offered was not provided and their recommendation to move to another resort one day prior to my departure was not an acceptable solution for me and my family.\"\\nTwo years ago I called to close my Capital one Account. XXXX Instead they offered to upgrade the account with the promise I would pay no more yearly fees. I took them at their word. Last year, in XX/XX/XXXX -- fee. I called, and shared this story and they refunded the fee. This year -- fee. I would like to have spoken to someone about this but their automated system would not let me so I chose to close the account. Supposedly they will automatically refund the annual fee, but I suspect I will not get back the late fee on the fee and the minimum interest charge on the fee. But the important part here is that you need to know that Capital one reps will tell you they are getting you into a program with no fees and then ... fees.\\n\"Date/Time of event : Tuesday, XX/XX/2019. Approx. XXXX XXXX Tried to access my credit card account with JPMorganChase online. Site responded that it did not recognize the computer I was using and needed to send a temporary code to validate the computer ( same computer I\\'ve been using to access site for almost 5 years ). \\n\\nWent though the notification routine multiple times first trying to initiate an email to my email address multiple times -- no email with temporary code ever received. Then went to telephone option to initiate call with temporary code. No callback with code ever received. \\n\\nTried this numerous times with same result -- nothing. Clearly a problem with the system that generates and/or sends the codes to customers in this situation. \\n\\nCalled customer service who indicated they could send me a text message with the temporary code. I told them I only have a landline and not a cellphone to receive a text message so they would have to send me the code someone other way -- like email -- or by sharing code with me on the phone ( the very landline and presumably they have caller ID to validate I was calling from the same number ). They said they could not do this, but that I could go to a JPMC branch ( many, many miles away and I only have an online credit card account with JPMC ). \\n\\nTo all this I replied that they were making their system problems my problem and were preventing me from accessing my account. I indicated this would be against the terms of the account and that I wanted to speak with their General Counsel \\'s office, to which they replied they could not provide a bank attorney to speak to but I could always contact my own attorney. I reconfirmed that we were being recorded so the tape could be pulled if necessary, then told them I would report it to CFPB instead and that they had extremely poor customer service. I suggested that if their CEO XXXX XXXX knew the facts of the situation and how their customer service responded so illogically to a customer, he would not be happy and invited them to share the tape with him ( expletives and all ) As of XXXX XXXX ET, I still do not have online access to my credit card account at JPMC.', \"On XX/XX/2019, I was informed by Discover that my credit card had possibly been used fraudulently. Upon checking my account I noticed five charges that had been made on my card by a scammer in XXXX XXXX, Florida. I live in Georgia and have never been to XXXX XXXX. Discover realized the mistake and credited the Florida charges. My account was closed and a new card was to be issued that I should receive in 5-7 days. Discover also added additional security questions to my  account including a verbal password stating these additional features should protect me. I also put a security freeze and fraud alert on my credit report. \\n\\nAfter 15 days, I contacted Discover to inform them that I never received a new card. A Discover representative said the new card had been sent but it had not been activated. When she confirmed my address, she used the XXXX XXXX location!!! The scammer was able to get a new Discover card in my name sent to her Florida address. How is this happening? \\n\\nAgain, I attempted to correct the address debacle. Discover closed that account and sent me a new card via XXXX XXXX to my address in Georgia. I received the card the next day. As of today ( XX/XX/2019 ), no new charges have been made to my credit card account. \\n\\nThe compliant is that prior to XX/XX/XXXX and since that time the scammer has been able to change my mother 's maiden name and change the verbal password created to protect me. How does a maiden name change? Shouldn't that create alarm? The scammer knows my name, social security number, and birthday. I welcome the third degree I now get when I call and I continue to request additional security on my account as the scammer seems to know everything typically used and Discover falls for it. Additional protection has been provided ; however, I continue to get emails and phone calls from Discover to verify that I want to change my email or home address, etc. \\n\\nRelated to this is that I've had fraudulent activity on my Discover Bank account as well ( {$4000.00} ). Previously, I didn't realize that Discover Bank and Discover Card are two different entities and require their own security options. When I thought I was safe with Discover credit card I find out later that Discover Bank doesn't have the new information and visa-versa. The scammer had access to both. \\n\\nEven with the new security measures Discover has taken, I can never trust the Discover credit card or Discover bank again. \\n\\nThank you PS : My VISA account was also compromised. One conversation resolved the matter. The account was closed and a new card was issued within days. Thank you XXXX XXXX.\", 'To Whom It May Concern : I am writing you to attempt to get assistance for my Chase Sapphire card, which ends in XXXX. I first reported this issue in XXXX, XXXX. \\nMy job requires travel and, in XXXX, sent me to XXXX XXXX, XXXX. Ive always liked to work out so I set out to find a gym. The only gym in town was XXXX XXXX so I signed on and added tanning to my membership, which was about {$59.00} a month. This was around XXXX XXXX of XXXX. That was the ONLY time I ever saw the owner of that gym. \\nIn XXXX of XXXX the tanning machine at that location was broken. In XXXX of XXXX, I started trying to get the tanning membership removed from my account, as I was still being charged for a BROKEN item that could not be used. I both emailed and called the gym. Neither have been replied to, TO THIS DAY. During this time I continued to go to work out at the gym, so I also left a note slid under the door of his office about wanting to cancel the tanning portion of my membership. Nothing was done so I got online and requested my money back for tanning on my membership at that time, you could report unauthorized use of your card online. They did the usual follow upsending letters confirming my request, etc. Somewhere around XXXX, XXXX, I opened up my credit card bill and found that XXXX had charged me {$260.00} dollars ( not positive on that amount but its close ) for no reason at all. I called Chase immediately and told them to block this merchant from my card. At this time, the representative that I spoke with at Chase confirmed that the owner of XXXX XXXX wasnt answering their calls/letters either. I also, AGAIN, sent email and a phone call to the gym to cancel. As I had requested that Chase block the merchant from my card, I had no reason to suspect that I would be charged again. I trusted them to do the right thing for me, their customer. \\nXXXX was a busy time for me. Im in the XXXX  and XXXX business as a XXXX and in XXXX, my entire XXXX  was laid off. Id made the decision to move to XXXX permanently so I was in between XXXX and XXXX  a lot, plus starting a new, very demanding job. Id put my credit card in my jewelry box and set it on autopay because I wasnt always getting my mail in a timely manner. I admittedly didnt open a statement for several months because I was just buried. That was my fault. \\nIn late XXXX or early XXXX of XXXX, I opened my statement and found a {$59.00} charge from XXXX XXXX. I went back several statements and found out that the payments to them NEVER STOPPED. I got online immediately and discovered that, for some strange reason, I was not able to dispute charges online any longer. So I got up from my desk ( after my move, I took a real job in an XXXX, no longer a XXXX ), signed out for my 15 minute break and sat, on hold, for well over ten minutes. I told the customer service representative what was going on and they said theyd look into it. \\nTheir idea of looking into it involved taking zero responsibility and offering zero help to me, their customer. I have several letters attached to this showing their response. The most recent letter is attached as well, which is the one I will be addressing here. In that letter, Chase states that they will not be helping me on this. They state that the XXXX XXXX charge were too old to do anything about. I disagree with that as it should have been addressed in XXXX of XXXX but as I stated above, I should have caught it. The kicker is their response to the XXXX XXXX charges. They state that they never received my reply when they sent letter for more information. These letters that they sent were dated the last week of XXXX and had to be returned by XX/XX/XXXX. They state they never received my reply, which is a BLATANT lie. Not only did I mail them ( due to the date I received them, they would not arrive to Chase by XX/XX/XXXX. Pretty sure they knew this when they mailed them. ) but I also submitted them online, as the letter stated I could do. You will see the PDFs of emails that I received stating that Chase had received my online message, and the date on those emails is prior to XX/XX/XXXX. They stated that due to my inaction in returning the letter that they would not help me any longer which again, was simply untrue, as proven by my emails that are attached. It was also mailed to them. \\nIn the meantime, due to Chases incompetence, I also submitted a XXXX XXXX XXXX complaint. This compliant is still outstanding. Someone named XXXX who claimed to be from Chases corporate office called and left me a voice mail. I called her back within five minutes and have yet to receive a return call.

The person then asked me to pay off my credit card in full, which i did with the bank information that they had given me. afterwards on XX/XX/XXXX they demanded that id buy them Gift cards from XX/XX/XXXX, saying that they just paid off my debt that it was the least i could do for them. so i did with the same credit card that they had cleared my debt off from. i bought {$800.00} worth in gift cards on XX/XX/XXXX, and another {$550.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. totaling {$1300.00}. the day after ( XX/XX/XXXX ), i was notified by best buy that the bank account used to pay off the original debt of {$1900.00} was cancelled and could not submit the payment. AFTER i had already bought {$1300.00} worth of gift cards on the credit card. i contacted the person to ask about the bank account and why it was closed before the payment submitted but the never replied to me. i called best buy the next day ( XX/XX/XXXX ) ask reported that my card was used for fraudulent purchases of gift cards and that my debt had accumulated to about {$3700.00}. however they told me that they could not help because technically i made the purchases of the cards and because of that it was not considered fraud. however in my defence, if the payment had not gone through yet, why did best buy allow more charges to apply to the card. why didnt they put a lock on my purchases while the payment was being submitted. i do not believe that i should be held responsible for the debt that was scammed off my card because the cards were not used by me nor did i benefit from the purchase. this has caused an immense amount of stress in my life and i hope that you guys will help me resolve this nightmare that im in. thank you very much.\\n\"My husband makes periodic charges on Google Play on behalf of my XXXX daughter. Because Google automatically keeps our credit card information on file, he has to take the extra step of removing our credit card after each purchase. If we could get a history of activity on Google, you would see that he does this every time he purchases something from Google Play on behalf of my daughter. Google keeps this information in their data files. On XX/XX/XXXX, he authorized a charge on Google Play for {$19.00}. He removed the card before he handed the tablet back to her. \\n\\nUnbeknownst to him, Google kept the card on file and my daughter accidentally charged {$1500.00} in XXXX charges between XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX. I learned of the charges on XX/XX/XXXX and contacted Google for a refund. They said it didn\\'t qualify since our card was in their system. My husband is very careful about removing the card after each purchase and says it had been removed. \\n\\nIn order to prove that he removed it, I asked Google for documentation concerning the account activity ( each click and command given ) for XX/XX/XXXX and I was told they could not provide that for me. This is the only way I can prove that my husband had removed the card so I have no recourse in getting these unauthorized charges refunded. \\n\\nI understand that Google had to refund millions of dollars in unauthorized charges such as these back in XXXX and I don\\'t understand why they are refusing to refund me now. \\n\\nWe have disabled all purchase capabilities on Google due to this issue. My complaint is not only that we can\\'t get a refund for charges we did not authorize, but that Google makes it hard to keep from being charged by automatically keeping your credit card on file and ready to be used after any purchase made. They should use it one time only and only store our card information if we expressly say we want it stored. The default should be a one-time use. For all the parents of children who like to make app purchases, this is the only protection we have from unauthorized charges. \\n\\nWe did all that we knew to do to avoid unauthorized charges and yet, when it happened, Google won\\'t refund us or provide the data needed to show that we removed the card. As of this writing, our credit card company, XXXX XXXX, also won\\'t refund us. They say that Google disputes our claim that these charges were unauthorized so they won\\'t credit the charges either. XXXX XXXX  \\'s fraud services failed us in notifying us of international charges XXXX XXXX is based in XXXX XXXX as I had indicated on our alerts and the fact that a company was charging our card repeatedly -- 20 charges in less than a few hours -- and didn\\'t send me an alert. I feel as both Google and XXXX are not offering the proper protection against the unauthorized charges that I\\'ve incurred.', 'On XX/XX/2019, I submitted a payoff payment of {$11000.00} to Chase for a credit card. The full balance was paid. Months later, I check my credit report to see that they have sent notice of late payment to the Credit bureaus. I look into it and see that nearly a month after payoff ( XX/XX/2019 ), they charged {$18.00} in Purchase Interest. They neglected to inform me of this via mail because I had \"\" paperless billing \\'\\' enabled, and the email account used to send notice was not monitored. As a result that fee snowballed into {$49.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX I attempted to contact Chase via their credit team to resolve the issue. I paid the balance of {$49.00} and requested they remove the late payment from my report. They refused to do so and claim it is not possible. I know this is not true, because I\\'ve seen elsewhere online that credit companies will often do this. My payment history with Chase has been 100 % on time for many years before this. This interest charge they assessed almost a full month after payoff has caused my credit score to drop over 100 points.

Most recently I had 3 instances of fraud in XX/XX/2019 that required them to issue new card numbers. In each case I have had my physical card in my possession and fraud was all carried out online. I don\\'t believe that Citi has investigated these issues or taken proper measures to protect my account. I also believe that Citi \\'s employees were in some way responsible for the fraud. I have had several conversations with their customer service and fraud department ( which are all located outside of the United States ). Nobody ever followed up with my concerns even though they claimed they would investigate. The most recent incident involved people signing up for recurring subscription services with my credit card and even after a new card number was issued they rolled those fraudulent subscriptions over to my new account. I was told by one representative that in fraud case they would not authorize any recurring charges on the new account by their policy. So at the very least they are incompetent in following their own policies and at worst they have people working internally that are taking part in fraud against their customers.

Mine was I was under a stay at home order, so my income did get behind. I reached out to the credit card companies, and while some offered time to pay bill- Macy \\'s decided to run a credit limit report and cut my credit card limit, based on current report. Once they cut the limit -- which I had about 2000 open on the card to use, then it shrinks my debt ratio on my credit score. Not very fair to people that are going through some troubling times. They should have made a call or sent a lettter prior. NOT sent me a letter of cutting my credit limit. \\n\\nI\\'ve gone back to work this week, I finally found a way to get in online and delay a couple of payments till I\\'m caught up. Thank you Macy \\'s, but your unfair credit score reviewing in a time where this is a serious problem for many, made me realize exactly how little you care about your customers. I\\'ve never maxed out the card, and I certainly would not do it now. I did not need a credit decrease based on current payment situation. While other companies over to wave late fees, Macy \\'s does not. They also do not give you an immediate answer regarding Covid help.

When I realized I clicked the wrong amount, I called the customer service phone number and talked to an agent named XXXX ( sp? ) who was unable to reverse even though I called her 2 minutes after. She stated that I would have to wait 10 Calendar days to reverse the payment and for me to call back on XX/XX/19. I heard her actually counting out the days while I was on the phone with her. On XX/XX/19 the amount was deducted from my checking account. On XX/XX/19, I called customer service at USAA again and talked to XXXX and she said it would be a reversed in 10 BUSINESS days after amount was cleared. On XX/XX/19, I called again and talked to XXXX and she said the reversal would be made that day and gave me a case number. During that call, she put me on hold and checked with someone else to make sure that could be done on XX/XX/XXXX ; and it was confirmed Today XX/XX/19, still no credit of said amount into my checking account. I called and talked to XXXX at USAA and she said that XXXX made a mistake and the it was to be 10 business day from XX/XX/19 for reversed payment. I asked to talk to a supervisor as I was confused as to exactly when my refund would be made. After 32 minutes on hold, I was connected to XXXX in the resolution center of USAA. She put me on hold as she looked into my issue. She came back to tell me that no direct reversal of credit to my bank was possible and I only had 2 options : 1 : Send a check to me which would take 2 days for the work order and another 10 days to be approved or 2 : Have a cash advance made through my back ( would charge me ).\\n\\nShe said that even though I was told by the above agents that this could be done ; she could not address what I was told, even though she saw all calls documented in their data. \\n\\nI am currently out of country and have a US address for all mail, but I'm not physically there to deposit the check. \\n\\nShe had no other options for me. I was on the phone a total of 1 hour and 6 minutes with no resolution of the matter.\\n\\nNow ; why did all other agents say a direct reversal was possible, but there was different details as to whether it would be 10 calendar vs. business days ; and what date would the count down begin : day of payment to USAA or date cleared by my bank. XXXX also told me that day didn't count either. \\n\\nI asked that the check be mailed overnight, but she could not guarantee that could be done. So ... .it will be possible that I would have to wait 32 or more days from payment of the credit card to resolution IF I can figure out how to deposit the check.

One of the banks refuses to provide the information even though both me and the detective have been to the bank on three separate occasIons ; I filed a complaint with the bank \\'s complaint line, I called the fraud department three times, I wrote the XXXX. I\\'ve gotten no response. \\n\\nAt first, the bank refused to provide the information, saying that only if me and the detective went into a branch together. When the police detective and I went to the bank together, a woman helping us showed us the attempted uses of my card on her computer screen but refused to download it or take a screen shot for the detective, saying she \"\" couldn\\'t \\'\\'. I read off the information and the detective wrote it down by hand. When he took the investigation to the DA \\'s office, the DA wanted him to get a bona fide transcript of the time, date and location of the times the thieves attempted to use my credit card. \\n\\nI went back to the bank, requesting a print-out of the attempts to use my stolen credit card. The woman was on vacation and nobody else could get the information. I called the fraud department again, and was told that this isn\\'t the first time he\\'s heard of this problem and that I should get a \"\" warrant \\'\\' -- I think he meant subpoena. Why should the police have to issue a subpoena to get information to prosecute people committing credit card fraud? Why does the bank refuse to cooperate in prosecuting credit card fraud? There is something really wrong going on here because the last fraud department person I spoke to told me this isn\\'t the first time people have called saying the bank won\\'t cooperate. \\n\\nI can not view the bank \\'s actions in any other light than aiding and abetting credit card fraud, and apparently that policy is institutionalized within the bank. This needs to be investigated.', 'I had activated a card on XX/XX/2019. My wallet was stolen, and took some time for me to get it back ( after filing a police report. \\nOnce I got the card, I noticed it expired XX/XX/2019. That is 6 months after being given the card. It has a {$210.00} balance. I tried using the card XX/XX/2019. 1 day after expiration. I looked at CFPB and it stipulates these cards must be good for 5 years. This is 5 months time passing between receiving card, and so called expiration. I called the company and asked for a settlement, or a replacement card. They said no. They have literally taken {$210.00} from me, 5 months after it was issued, a new dad who can not afford to have {$210.00} just stolen away!', \"I am writing to ask for help in a dispute over the Citi Thank Your Preferred Card. I was charged approximately {$72.00} in XX/XX/XXXX for an XXXX on a card that was never activated. The card charged on XXXX 's end had different digits than the card I had originally saved 4 years ago ( and had expired XX/XX/XXXX ). The new card was charged but never activated on Citi 's end. \\n\\nThe new card was never activated nor used. But somehow, XXXX updated the payment method and populated it with the new card information including a new expiration date, even though it wasnt active. I spoke with the XXXX team and they said that when they charged a card, they have to get a confirmation from the credit card company that the card is indeed active before they charge can proceed. What I dont understand is how they were able to charge a card that was never activated. When Ive tried to book XXXX or another service with an expired or inactive cards, I will get an error. But XXXX charge went through. I didnt realize this until XXXX of XXXX. Since I no longer used the Citi card, I wasnt receiving statements or bills to inform me of the charge. As a result, I didnt learn about the charge until XXXX, by which time multiple late fees were charged to that original {$72.00} charge. It is now over {$260.00} and has gone to collections, which has negatively affected my credit. Ive never missed a credit card payment and my credit score was 700+. But I am afraid that this incident has seriously dinged by credit score in the interim.\", 'XXXX XXXX store card issued and serviced by TD. When trying to make a payment on line and if using wrong user name it does not say that, it only prompts to new password. Then when I try to create new password, as that is what the TD payment system directed me to, it doesn\\'t accept my SS # thinking that my number was entered in wrong by the store. In reality the user name is not right and this continues every month when trying to make a payment. confusion causes late fee of {$28.00}. I feel this is a \"\" gotcha \\'\\' tactic to drive revenue on late fees because this is interest free account for 36 months. \\nThe customer service rep said their are other payment methods on line but I could never get on line because the user number was not correct, again it would only tell me password reset and then not allow password reset which then causes me to manually call and if I\\'m at a location where that is not possible or it\\'s past hours or I\\'m on airplane or in meetings all day then and I\\'m past my US mail deadline to mail the payment, then I\\'m charged. \\nThey offered a reversal of late fee bACK in XXXX, but every month I have the same issue and sometimes it gets me - thus the unneeded difficulty that causes confusion, frustration and then a late fee that no matter what you say they will only refund every 12 months. \\nAll of my bank accounts that I pay on line will tell me when the user code is incorrect, but not TD. I feel this is a harmful tactic to make late fee revenue in place of interest free.\"\\nThis particular account situation that is lately filing on my own credit document has a seriously unfavorable relation to my personal ability to obtain a present loan application.

Thanks!\\nI spoke with someone from XXXX comenity in XX/XX/XXXX by phone that I was not receiving my statements. She stated it was going to the incorrect email address and corrected the issue. At that time, I had a late fee so she credited the late fee for me. Again I am not receiving my notices and the email address provided is the correct email address that I am receiving all of my other comenity statements to make payment, such as the XXXX card. I contacted the bank yesterday to advise them that I am not receiving my statements causing me to incur late fees every month, although I make a payment possibly the day after every time. I inquired about having the funds automatically taken out each month so that I can avoid these late fees racking up on my account. They informed me that they do not offer that type of service and it is nothing they can do about the late fees. So, as of today, I believe I have two or three late fees on the account that are not really my doing and it is nothing they can do to prevent it. I just want some type of convenience or to have the late fees waived since there is nothing they can offer me to make sure I receive my statements by email on time or have payment automatically drafted. I spoke with my personal bank who can automatically send the payments for me but I do not want to have to pay the current late fees if that be the case.\\n\"Good evening, On XX/XX/2019 I purchased a XXXX XXXX ticket using Chase Ultimate Rewards Points with my Chase Sapphire Reserve Credit card. XXXX XXXX canceled my return flight and issued me a partial refund for {$150.00}. XXXX informed me on XX/XX/2019 that the refund was processed. It\\'s been weeks and Chase refuse to refund my account. \\nI waited the appropriate amount of time for the refund to appear on my account but it never did. I contacted Chase Card services using the secure messages feature and informed them of the issue. Chase told me the refund processed to a different credit card number from the one I have, and that I\\'d need to work out my refund with the airline. I contacted XXXX again, who informed me that when a customer books a flight with credit card points, the credit card company itself reserves the flight through a partnered travel agency, and that XXXX had reimbursed Chase \\'s partnered travel agency, because XXXX can only reimburse in the exact method in which the flight was reserved. \\nA XXXX representative told me to contact Chase again and tell the credit card company to reach out to their agency, confirm the {$150.00} reimbursement, and then forward the refund to my account. I messaged Chase on XX/XX/2019 and told them this issue and asked them to confirm my refund with their agency. Chase sent me a repeat semi-automated response to contact XXXX again, and claimed that I hadn\\'t booked the flight using Chase ( even though I definitely booked the flight with Chase Ultimate Rewards Points and I have the email confirmation to prove it ). Chase customer service is sending me in circles, refusing to follow up with their own travel agency, refusing to read the messages I sent them with pertinent information, and refusing to process my refund to my account. I have spent over twenty hours contacting Chase and two months of frustration waiting for my refund. \\nFurthermore, when I spoke to a Chase representative on the phone on XX/XX/XXXX she was less than helpful. She told me XXXX cancelled my return flight because I\\'d failed to arrive at the airport for my departing flight ( this was false and easily disproved. I\\'d flown on the departing flight the day before ). She was also unable to receive emails, so I couldn\\'t show her the XXXX flight or refund information. When I learned I could not forward documents to Chase employees while on the phone, I decided to use the secure messaging. But this method of communicating with Chase has proven just as ineffective. \\nI am attaching to this complaint all of my messages with Chase, proof that XXXX processed my refund, and proof that I purchased the flight through Chase.\"\\nIn XX/XX/2019, my wife and I purchased a massage chair from Mattress Firm. They had informed us about making a monthly payment for this chair. Since receiving the chair, we have been billed several different amounts. Synchrony bank first sent a bill for {$92.00}, then {$37.00} and now they have sent another for {$67.00}. At this point, we have been trying to return the chair because we feel this will negatively impact our credit and do not want the hassle. Mattress Firm is unwilling to return the chair. Then, in XX/XX/2019, we received a bill from XXXX XXXX  for the same chair! We were unaware of two different credit companies billing us for the same product. I have filed a fraud claim with XXXX, and also informed them that my salesman is not answering his phone or returning any calls about this matter. The last time I spoke to him about the XXXX issue he told me not to worry about paying them! At this time, we are unsure of what to do or where to go, but we definitely do not want this chair anymore!\\n\"On XX/XX/XXXX, I purchased windows for my home ( as the windows were beyond repair ). Lowes worked with me on this, and stated that I could get the promotional 24 months interest free. I knew that I would have this paid for and have always made my payments allocated to where the \"\" promotional purchases \\'\\' were paid and plus the additional principal and interest for that particular month. The purchase of the windows were {$5000.00}. \\nIn the latter part of XXXX, my washing machine and dryer went out as well. Upon having to purchase these during the \"\" XXXX XXXX Sale \\'\\', I knew that the windows would be paid for ( since obviously they were purchased first, then the washer and dryer ), but I was willing to pay the interest on the washer and dryer vs. the windows. \\nIt was XX/XX/XXXX when I realized that Lowes had placed the washer and dryer purchase BEFORE the windows ; therefore, the payments were all being applied to them and NOT the windows. I panicked and immediately emailed them to inquire. I got a very valid response, and the representative did not answer my question as to why they placed this purchase BEFORE the windows, so today, I saw where they put {$3400.00} of JUST interest on my credit card statement, which put me negative on my card. I don\\'t know what to do as they completely did NOT place in the disclosures that the purchases would be placed in a particular order, when it\\'s common sense that the \"\" older purchases \\'\\' are paid for first, then the rest, which is how all other processes are completed ... .. or so I thought?', 'I signed up for the Capital One Savor credit card in XX/XX/XXXX. The promotion at the time was \"\" spend {$3000.00} within your first 3 months and receive {$300.00} back. \\'\\' I can\\'t find the exact language because it\\'s not posted online, nor has Capital One been willing to share the original terms of the promotion with me. \\n\\nMy account opened XX/XX/XXXX. I received the credit card in the mail 7-10 business days later. My first transaction date was XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nMy XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX billing statement transactional total was {$110.00} My XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX billing statement transaction total was {$1700.00} My XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX billing statement transaction total was {$1000.00} I had a XX/XX/XXXX transaction of {$49.00} I had a XX/XX/XXXX transaction of {$61.00} 90 days after my account opening on XX/XX/XXXX is XX/XX/XXXX 90 days after I first received the card in the mail on XX/XX/XXXX is XX/XX/XXXX When I didn\\'t receive the {$300.00} back as a statement credit, I called Capital One on XX/XX/XXXX. The customer service representative said they\\'d need to escalate my case and file a petition on my behalf with the department that handles petitions for promotional cases. A few business days later, I missed a call from the Capital One petition department. The voicemail said to call back the Capital One customer service number to learn the results of my case. I called the number and was told my case was denied. When I asked to be sent what was written on my behalf to the petition department so I could ensure my case was properly presented to them, the representative said they couldn\\'t share it with me. When I asked why my case was denied, the rep said I hadn\\'t spent {$3000.00} in 90 days. I stated that the Capital One promotional offer terms were confusing. I asked, Did I need to spend $ XXXX in 90 days, in 3 months, or in 3 billing cycles? I asked, When does the clock start for calculating transaction totals? When I opened the account? When I got the card in the mail? When I activated the card? The rep said that the clock starts the day the account is opened and that I did not spend $ XXXX within 90 days of that date ( XX/XX/XXXX ). I told the rep those terms were unclear to me. I asked for the original terms to be shared with me and was told that wasn\\'t possible. I said it\\'s misleading because how can I begin to spend money toward the $ XXXX transactional total if I don\\'t have the card in my possession. I told the rep that Capital One was setting customers up to not reach the $ XXXX mark because the clock starts sooner than customers have the card in their permission and sooner than customers are made aware of. I asked that my case be re-presented to the petition department. I was told this wasnt possible. I asked to speak to the petition department. I was told the department is only capable of outgoing calls. I asked to speak with the reps supervisor. The supervisor said he was the highest possible person to speak with about my issue. He reiterated that I couldnt petition again and that I couldnt be put in touch with the department that made the decision to deny my petition. I reiterated the misleading advertising and terms from Capital One regarding this promotion. The supervisor said there was nothing further that could be done about it. He stated I had spent {$2900.00} in 90 days from the account opening. I stated I had spent {$3000.00} in 90 days from receiving the card in the mail and activating the card the day I received it. I asked him to review and share with me the original terms of the promotion. He said he was unable to do so. I should have received {$300.00} back from Capital One because I spent more than $ XXXX within 90 days of receiving my credit card in the mail. They did not give me any money back because I spent less than $ XXXX within 90 days of the account opening.\"\\nI made several payments to my Best Buy card in the month of XX/XX/2020 and I noticed they put my payments on hold and unable to get hold of Citibank so I can get theses payments released and I dont have no patience in waiting 7 days at all and the fraud rep told me she can only be on the phone for 5 mins but my bank which is Citibank clear the funds from several payments and best citi refused to contact my bank to verified funds and said they can be on the phone.

I told the teller that I was there to pay off the balance on my credit card. I gave the teller {$180.00} first, which was supposed to be put towards the balance of my credit card. The remaining balance on my credit card was to be paid by my fiance through a second transaction. We asked the teller if it were easier if he were to pay the remainder from his debit card or with cash. He was alreading taking money out of the atm, and she said it would be easy to pay in cash. He paid the rest of the balance, which was the remainder ( {$160.00} ). We left that day under the impression that the card was paid off completely. \\n\\nA week and a half later I went to the bank to pay off the next round of charges which were equal to {$170.00}. The teller on that day told me that I owed over {$400.00}, and I said that couldn\\'t be right, so she told me to call the number on the back of my credit card. I made no payments that day, because I wanted to resolve any misappropriated funds. When I called the customer service credit division, they told me to have a copy of any receipts I had from that day faxed to accounting. I went to the branch to do this, and the fax was not working that day. It was at this time we noticed that the money was deposited into a wrong account, not put towards the credit card as the teller was instructed to do. We could not find a transaction receipt for the other funds that were given to the teller to pay off the rest of the credit card. I called Customer Service of the Credit Division again that night, and was told to call them from the bank branch to help resolve the issue. \\n\\nA couple days later I went in to speak with someone about resolving the issue. It was the same teller that made the mistakes on the XX/XX/XXXX. Innitially she set up an appointment for the following XX/XX/XXXX. She cancelled that appointment and told us that a Chairman of the Board would call us because she didn\\'t feel comfortable resolving the issue. I instead payed the {$170.00} towards the CC so that any remaining funds were those that I believed I payed off via the bank when I gave them cash to put towards the balance and also associated late fees because those payments were misappropriated. I always keep up with my payments, and if there are issues I do my best to resolve them in a timely manner. \\n\\nThat week, XXXX, a chairman of the board called. She talked in circles about information I would need to provide to them. She told me to fax what receipts I had to her. She told me many times she could not reference transactions without a receipt. I wanted to at least sent her what I had, which was a copy of the receipt for {$180.00} I got for money given to the teller ... .money that was supposed to go towards paying off my CC balance, but instead was accidently deposited by the teller into someone else \\'s account ( I did not authorize a deposit of {$180.00}, it was supposed to be a payment towards my CC balance ). We could not locate the other transaction, and though someone from Customer Service in the Credit Division told me that the bank should be able to locate it through the records from the day, XXXX seemed unable and unwilling to help without that specific transaction information. I told her I would fax the information I had over and she assured me 3 times that she would call me the following Wednesday to touch base no matter what. \\n\\nI faxed the receipt on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX tried calling on XX/XX/XXXX but I was unavailable. I waited for her call on XX/XX/XXXX and did not receive one. I even called her office around XXXX to try to reach her, but got her answering machine. I also called XX/XX/XXXX and got no response, no call back. I then called XX/XX/XXXX and left a message again. I reached out to the Customer Service line once more and XXXX assured me he would let XXXX know I was trying to reach her. \\n\\nXXXX finally called back later on XX/XX/XXXX. I was so frustrated by this point, having poured many hours into resolving this issue. XXXX told me that the receipt that I sent was a deposit into someone else \\'s account and that she would need proof I was making a payment towards my credit card. Well, if the teller hadn\\'t made a mistake then I would have the proper information, but this is one of the reasons I was calling. The money wasn\\'t put towards the credit card, as I instructed the teller to do. I was so frustrated at this point and heated, I resolved to reach out to consumer finance to file a complaint. I should not have so much trouble trying to resolve this. \\n\\nWhether this was a mistake or intentional misappropriation of funds by the teller, the bank has done little to help me actually resolve this issue. The bank doesn\\'t even seem to care that the teller made mistakes, telling me they can\\'t do anything to help me. That is why I am reaching out to the CFPD. \\n\\nI hope that the CFPD can assist me in resolving this issue. I have had good standing with the bank so far and I do not wish this to negatively affect my credit.', 'I applied for a credit card from HSBC and was told I has to go through a process through the HSBC Fraud Operations Team, this is what they sent me. \\nDear XXXX, Thank you for your application.

I received NO INFORMATION on the approval, I received NO INFORMATION regarding the payments I was approved for and I received NO INFORMATION on any further steps. \\n\\nThe only reason I knew I was approved is because the online portal showed \"\" approved \\'\\'. NO FURTHER INFORMATION PROVIDED. I then call into the call center to get more information. The first two times, I get people who are clearly incompetent and can give me no further information. The last call I made, today XX/XX/XXXX, the woman tells me that they will make two additional \"\" courtesy \\'\\' payments. She can not tell me the amount of the payments, only that they will post \"\" after my statement closes \\'\\' which will be AFTER MY DUE DATE creating a late payment. Apparently, them paying late and putting customers \\' credit history at risk IS SO COMMON THAT THEY ADJUST THE LATE FEES BUT DO NOT FIX THE CREDIT REPORT. How horrible is it that people pay for insurance only to find out their credit history may still be harmed? That the company has such a disregard for their customer that they pay late? \\n\\nThen she told me that there is MORE PAPERWORK to fill out after the 90 days. What paperwork? She can\\'t give me further information now. When will I receive it? She doesn\\'t know. In fact, she looks and it shows in their internal system that I have received NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BEYOND A BENEFIT FORM AT ALL. There is no more information to be had except that my payment will post after the statement closing date - making it late for an UNDETERMINED AMOUNT that may even be less than my minimum. \\n\\nThis is the worst part - all agents then advise me that, even though my claim has been approved and, even though their program says they will make the minimum payment - I SHOULD CONTINUE MAKING MINIMUM MONTHLY PAYMENTS ON MY ACCOUNT BECAUSE IF I DON\\'T THE ACCOUNT MAY DEFAULT. THEY ADMIT THAT THEY ARE A COMPLETE SCAM AND MAY NOT MAKE THE PAYMENTS PROMISED. \\n\\nThis company needs to be shut down. There is no hope. It is my understanding the CFPB has already fined them for this scam, please know they are put this scam on full throttle now, charging a large premium and leaving customers with UNPAID BILLS, LATE PAYMENTS, COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF PAPERWORK AND NO CORRESPONDENCE ON WHAT FURTHER INFORMATION IS NEEDED FOR A CLAIM APPROVAL. \\n\\nSynchrony should be ashamed of it self for preying on the vulnerable and the CFPB should be ashamed of itself for not shutting them down when it had the chance. I sob sometimes because of what these people have put me through. Please note, I will also be sending a copy of this complaint to my congressman, senators and state representatives.', \"I disputed charges with USAA.

I made a case saying that I NEVER received disclosures, that I had XXXX income and there were potential UDAP violations and I would report my issues to the CFPB to review the practices of promotional expiration notification. I was amazed as all parties I spoke to only defended Comenitys position with the sole explanation that the E-Statement was the source of the promotional expiration details. I was utterly appalled as I made a case explaining that I work for a bank and have seen the CFPB continually question communication methods and stress availability and transparency of details related to charges. I incurred a {$2000.00} charge with no additional attempts to communicate the expiration of my promotional period. I shared that the E-Statement was embedded, emails included payment details but no indication of period expiring, no written communication, calls or texts regarding the expiration either. I attempted to explain that this was highly questionable because Comenity obviously benefitted greatly and I was significantly harmed. The optics and response appear that Comenity deliberately does the minimum to communicate the end of an expiration period for their own benefit. \\nFinally, on XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with XXXX and she was the first supervisor to listen and recite policy or use my election of an E-Statement and their inclusion of the expiration within the E-Statement as a defense. As she listened, she shared that Comenity also extends a grace period to pay a balance of 3 days for the expiration of promotional period ; additionally she added that on XX/XX/XXXX Comenity began extending promotional periods up to 90 days. She submitted a request to have my promotional period extended based on the grace period and extension due to financial hardship due to COVID-19. XXXX made no promises because she said it is out of her control if they will approve the extension. \\nI am asking that the promotional period be extended by 30 days to avoid the {$2000.00} in deferred interest, balance of account has been paid as of XX/XX/XXXX. The allowance of the 3 day grace period and availability to extend the promotional period due to COVID-19 should be suffice to remove the deferred interest and extend the promotional period so the balance can be paid in full. \\n\\nAdditionally, I request that Comenity \\'s practice and tools for communicating promotional expiration across \"\" ALL \\'\\' cards be examined for significant negative consumer impact. The details aren\\'t included within the payment emails that are distributed ( include due date, payment amount and balance ), no additional forms of communication are attempted when on e-statements, e-statement is where dates can be expiration dates can be found, e-statement is embedded within account summary, no separate or promotional expiration specific communication was sent outside of normal payment reminder emails, on payment screen there is no indicator of approaching promotional interest expiration. \\n\\nAppears that no process for call center to log or escalate consumer violations or regulatory violation complaints. I made a request to escalate and no action was formalized. There was separate occurrences which were initiated by myself.', 'I have never been late on my Citi XXXX XXXX card ( or any other card or bill for that matter ). I pay the balance in full every month. All of my 4 credit cards are due on the XXXX of the month. At the beginning of the month, I set up all of my bank drafts for my bills. For some reason, none of the 4 drafts went through for the XXXX payments. I did not notice the error until XX/XX/ and paid each in full immediately when I discovered the error. \\nI use the Citi card for almost all charges, resulting in tens of thousands of merchant fees to Citi. \\nThe lesser used cards provided one-time courtesy waivers of interest and late fees. I contacted Citi and they refuse to extend me any courtesy waiver whatsoever. \\nAs I wrote to \"\" XXXX \\'\\' in our chat : \"\" Please know that my other cards with lesser usage have waived the interest and fees [ caused by this one-time mistake ]. Be sure to let your supervisors ( and anyone else know ) that this request was for a courtesy waiver of {$140.00} on an account that charges tens of thousands of dollars. Citi must think it\\'s the only game in town. Say goodbye to all of those merchant charges and monies you make from my use on this card. I will shift the majority of charges to other, more forgiving, card issuers. \\'\\' I then offered Citi one more chance to re-consider it\\'s position and credit my account. \"\" XXXX \\'\\' told me nothing could be done and I could call a supervisor.

I handed my card. I was not given a receipt, and I did not sign anything. \\n\\nOn my Capital One credit card statement, I saw that the charge ended up being for {$36.00}. I did not authorize this charge. I did not sign anything. I did not approve this number. \\n\\nI attempted to reach XXXX, the merchant, but failed. \\n\\nI called my credit card company to notify them that I did not authorize this charge. \\n\\nThey requested *evidence* of how much I had authorized. I indicated that I have none, since I was not given a receipt, and I did not sign anything. \\n\\nOn account of my not providing evidence that I *did not* make the charge, Capital One denied my dispute, and informed me that the charge would be reinstated. \\n\\nThis is *not* reasonable. I *did not* authorize the transaction. And the onus is not on me to show that I didn\\'t ; the burden of proof, clearly, is on the merchant and the credit card issuer, to show that I authorized the charge.\"\\nI signed up for a Bank of America XXXX XXXX Master Card. I  specifically asked the flight attendant who was selling the cards for BOA if there was an annual fee. She said no. BOA charged me a fee. I called BOA on XX/XX/20 and after spending approximately 35 minutes the agent said that BOA would not waive the fee and the only way for them to do so would be for BOA to close the account which would adversely affect my credit. I asked to speak to a supervisor and the agent said no. I asked to speak to XXXX XXXX, CEO, and the agent said no. She said that any escalation of the issue would reflect poorly on her. I said that I empathized with her, given that BOA put me in the exact same situation. She declined to provide her name or an identifying number for the call, other than to say that she is in West Virginia. She then transferred me back to the number that started the process. BOA must refund the {$59.00} annual fee immediately and stop the deceptive advertising and stop silencing customer complaints.\\n\"My name is XXXX XXXX and I have been a dedicated, loyal and very happy client of AmEx since XXXX. \\n\\nI have AmEx cards both on the business and personal side and have been pleased and delighted with my experience up until earlier this year. \\nMy account numbers are XXXX and XXXX and if you look up my accounts you may find the I have never been late on any payments, nor misused or handled my accounts improperly. I have built up my credit during the years and have taken full responsibility of my actions. There has never been any issues with AmEx during my membership until earlier this year. In fact, my membership has been celebrated to higher statues during my tenure. \\n\\nDuring the month of XX/XX/XXXX, I was randomly requested for a financial review due to transaction of my AmEx Business Platinum card ( XXXX XXXX {$9000.00} ). \\nSince this incident, my experience with American Express has deteriorated dramatically and is at its lowest point imaginable. \\n\\nTo further detail, allow me to briefly share some of my recent experience : - Early XX/XX/XXXX, I received a phone call from AmEx with Financial Review Team Member XXXX, who within 1-2 minutes of the conversation the threatened to cancel my accounts if I had not provided a tax return within 1-2 weeks. The representative was incredibly insensitive and arrogant during the phone call and kept on adding restrictions and time constraints to heighten his position. This experience has remained the same during the entire review process plus his inability to respond to questions, respond back on a timely fashion, refer other colleagues to help during his absence or get supervision to step into his position during times when he was unable to take action. I would reprimand or fire that representative due to way he treats clients. In fact, I would review the entire Financial Review Team \\'s organization and set up as majority of the times, majority of the times nobody is available to speak with the clients, phone messages can not be left or goes unheard and there is no way of communicating via email with this team. To further detail my disappointment with Financial Review Team, they have incorrectly requested transcript from the IRS, lost mail which was sent certified, ignored digital communication by clients ( AmEx upload ). The Financial Review team has blamed the United States Postal Office for fault, blamed me for faults, blamed the IRS for faults, which is not only unprofessional, but so wrong in front of a client. I have spent an enormous amount of time on the phone with the team without avail. Called at least 2-3 times per week since early XX/XX/XXXX, which each call takes approx. 20-60 minutes, to inquire about status updates, provided all of the requested information and STILL my accounts have been closed. \\n\\n- During early XX/XX/XXXX, I was also fraudulently charged on my AmEx account, including the {$9000.00} mentioned above. Due to this fact, I\\'ve disputed these charges with AmEx, which totals approx. {$30000.00}. Initially, I was told to wait approximately 6-8 weeks for the case to be completely finalized. Periodically, I have called to learn about any updates. By periodically, I mean approx. once per week plus checking online for any updates via Dispute Management. It is  to my dismay that the Dispute Management online has not been working correctly for these disputes, which has resulted in me having to call the customer care number. During each call, I have been transfered at least 3-4 times to different departments during the last 3-4 weeks of the dispute time. I\\'ve spoken with AmEx representatives on extremely poor phone lines, far away in some Eastern countries without any knowledge of the situation. I\\'ve inquired about the actual process of Disputes and have been given very different information each time I\\'ve called. \\n\\nIn conclusion, it is my highest hope and desire to have a repaired relationship with AmEx and have my accounts re-instated ASAP. I have done nothing but to comply with AmEx requests including submitting my IRS tax return of XXXX on a timely fashion ( proof of mailing has been provided via online uploads to The Financial Review Team ). This is my last resort before retaining an attorney in order to pursue this case further.', 'My wife and I have long been account holders of Citi Bank checking and credit cards. In XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX, we received a fraud alert message from Citi Bank Gold. We immediately called Citi Bank Gold to verify that we did not make any purchases on this Citi Bank Gold credit card. The Customer Care Service representative confirmed with us that the Citi Bank Gold credit card would be CANCELLED immediately. At the same time, my wife and I cut up and shredded that Citi Bank Gold credit card, and threw it away in the trash. Also, and importantly we did NOT order and/or receive a new Citi Bank Gold credit card. We rarely ever used Citi Bank Gold credit card. This card was for emergency purposes only. From this moment on in XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX, we, XXXX and XXXX XXXX did NOT own a Citi Bank Gold Credit Card, therefore this Citi Bank Gold Credit Card did NOT EXIST. \\n\\nFast forward, we received a letter from Citi Cards on XX/XX/XXXX regarding making payments and losing charging privileges. I immediately called to ask what this was regarding, and the Customer Care agent was very vague and not helpful. I called another number several times to no avail, and was hung up on several times. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX we received a letter from Citibank Security Services that there are charges of {$13000.00} that will remain on our account. I immediately made phone calls to the Fraud division. The Customer Care agent said they would send this information to their supervisor, and that we would receive a call soon. NO CALL ever came. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX my wife and I walked into the Citi Bank XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX NY XXXX to speak to a bank manager to assist with this matter. The manager, my wife, and myself were all on a speaker phone conversation with a supervisor from Fraud Division, and requested for an immediate investigation. This supervisor would not detail the charges, and said it would take 30-90 days for them to reach back to us. NOBODY ever reached out to us. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX we received similar letters from Citi Cards regarding these charges. \\n\\n\\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX, I called and spoke to a supervisor named XXXX from Fraud division. Reference # XXXX. Even though this Gold Citi Card was CANCELLED, and NOT IN USE, XXXX said there were 56 transactions made on this NON EXISTANT GOLD CITI CARD from XX/XX/XXXX through no specific date. Charges that included XX/XX/XXXX over {$1600.00} at XXXX ; On XXXX XXXX, XXXX {$4600.00} at XXXX XXXX XXXX ; and XXXX XXXX, XXXX {$1100.00} at XXXX XXXX. \\n\\nAlso, charges included 19 XXXXXXXX XXXX order, and 3 XXXX trips. \\n\\nOf course I asked for an immediate investigation. My wife and I live in a doorman building with surveillance cameras everywhere. If Citibank did an investigation they would track the XXXXXXXX XXXX orders and addresses, and also see if there was a delivery to our building and apartment. All deliveries occur in our lobby with cameras, and have to be signed in with our doorman. We have NEVER ordered from XXXX XXXX. We have never made purchases with our previous Citi Bank Gold credit card at XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, or XXXX XXXX. \\n\\nXXXX, the supervisor said he submitted the report to his supervisor, saying it would take up to 90 days for us to hear back. NOTHING! \\n\\n\\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX we received a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX saying that XXXX XXXX XXXX has taken over that account offering us to pay a compromise of {$11000.00}. Therefore a collection agency was taking over. \\n\\n\\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I called and spoke to XXXX XXXX from the Citibank Investigations Fraud Department in Florida. I explained all the detailed information that I explained to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. She said she can see these similar transactions, and would report this to her supervisor, and that it would take 90 days for us to hear back NOTHING! \\n\\n\\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX we received similar letters from XXXX XXXX XXXX compromising us to pay {$8800.00} charges. \\n\\n\\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX I called and spoke to XXXX XXXX in South Dakota XXXX a supervisor from Security Operations XXXX XXXX seemed to be the most helpful, and we thought this would finally get resolved. He said he was sending this investigation report to his superior XXXX XXXX, and that we would receive a phone call within 5-7 business days.

In XX/XX/XXXX, we received a high credit score of XXXX. We were in the process of purchasing a second home. We decided to not purchase, but were in talks of refinancing our current condominium in XXXX, New York. We have always been stellar in paying all of our bills. We never owned money to any credit card companies. Through XX/XX/XXXX, we have had EXCELLENT CREDIT. \\n\\n\\n\\nWe NEVER purchased anything on this Gold Citi Card in the year XXXX and beyond.

I also want peace of mind.. thank you\"\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I disputed a charge for XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX. Citibank immediately reversed the charge on that date. When I realized the charge was valid on XX/XX/XXXX, I went into the statement, selected that charge and asked to reverse the chargeback. When I did that, it took me to another screen and it said an error happened. And I noticed at that time that a disputed charge from XXXX of XXXX for XXXX appeared, but I took no other action. When I went into the statement again on XX/XX/XXXX to pay, the charge of XXXX was now part of my balance ( attached statement ). I immediately contacted Citibank and reported this. We spoke to XXXX who gave us a case number of XXXX and said it would have to be sent to their investigation unit and we should hear back within 7-10 business days. On XX/XX/XXXX, we still had not heard anything and the charge was not reversed, we contacted Citibank once again and spoke to someone else who said, after we explained what happened, that this is a KNOWN problem and it has happened to others before and that not to worry, it will get taken care of. On XX/XX/XXXX, we still had not heard anything and no changes had occurred to our account, we asked for a supervisor. We spoke to her and again she acknowledged on a recorded phone call that they are aware of this problem but they could not do anything about it. We asked to have it escalated to her manager. We received a phone call later that day from XXXX who said there was nothing that could be done. We have also contacted Costco since it\\'s through them that we have our credit card. After numerous emails with them and phone calls, they determined they could not assist. We had a chat conversation again with Citibank on XX/XX/XXXX ( see attached ) where they said we would have to go back to the merchant since they could no longer do anything. This was their computer glitch error and we are not going to chase this money down that should not have been reversed. I hope you can assist. thank you.\\n\"Back on XX/XX/19 Barclays XXXX  Business Credit Card, was transferred two payment of {$2000.00} and {$4000.00} dollars.

I received bills electronically and due to my own fault, never noticed it/ This year in XXXX I was going to pay off my CITI card and I contacted CITI for a fee. As I was talking to customer service, I asked about the fee that I suddenly noticed. I was informed that I must have signed up for it. I demanded it be canceled and I asked to be provided proof that I even signed up. They said I must have clicked the option or agreed to it. They put me through to XXXX   and was under the impression that I would receive a reimbursement. 30 days went by and I did not see a credit so I called again. I paid off all my bill in XXXX but what I thought they owed me back - approximately XXXX. They could not locate my request and submitted it again. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received the first denial from CITI. I was upset and called customer service again 3 - 4 days later. I said that I was cancelling my card and I was then transferred to a supervisor - XXXX. He lead me to believe that again, I would be reimbursed and I asked again for proof that I actually signed up. I also mentioned the letter that I received in XXXX that I was being refunded XXXX in fees due to a settlement with CFPB. I asked for proof it was credited. 30 days later - XX/XX/XXXX, I received a second denial letter. This time I gave very negative feedback and was contacted by another senior account specialist. He said I did receive the credit for XXXX. I told him that CITI behaved in a predatory manner. He basically didn\\'t care and transferred me back to a XXXX member.

At that time I setup my online account and activating of my free credit monitoring account. \\n\\nShortly after, about 8 days, my card/ was cancelled and the account closed.

It caused my credit score to drop substantially.I contacted Chase and also wrote then goodwill letter asking to remove this account, as it was closed without explanation and also only open 8 days. I also explained to them that credit reports every 30 day account info and this account was not open even 14 days to report anything. I advised them that creditors aren\\'t required by law to report borrowers \\' account information to the credit bureaus.

Something that WASNT even required when opening the account! \\nSo anything on my credit report that resulted in their decision to decrease my balance then becomes irrelevant if my income is enough?! Thats a very backwards philosophy. \\nWhat AMEX does NOT consider when making these decisions is the affect it has on the overall credit utilization of the consumer and how decreasing the available credit by that much, that quickly, is catastrophic to a consumers credit report. \\nDecisions like this should be thoroughly considered and CAREFULLY looked into before they occur. \\nI had no drastic changes in my credit report, my income has not changed and even if my utilization was higher than normal, all of my accounts are current and paid on time. Those should be the biggest factors considered when deciding to decrease a consumers available credit. \\nCutting a consumers credit limit by {$12000.00} in less than a year is unacceptable.

I previously owned the Delta Platinum card, and I wanted the Delta Reserve one, which is a tier above the Platinum one. I called and was told that I could just UPGRADE my existing card to the Reserve, and that I would still get the sign in bonus, so I did the upgrade. The next time I called, I was told I WOULD NOT get the bonus since I had upgraded instead of signed up for a new one. I was obviously very frustrated by that and asked how that could be fixed, and AMEX told me they could just UNDO the upgrade and then I could just sign up for a new Delta Reserve card, and that I would get the full sign up bonus. So that is what I did, once more trusting what AMEX personnel were telling me. After I hit the minimum spend to receive the sign up bonus, I noticed I did not receive any bonus at all, so I called AMEX again, only to be told that I would NOT receive any bonus whatsoever, SINCE I HAD ALREADY OWNED A DELTA RESERVE CARD PREVIOUSLY (??? ).

Made purchases, used Wells Fargo App to ensure all transactions were posted to account. The app shows details like Transaction Date and Posting Date. I reviewed ALL transactions, and they ALL showed that they have been posted to the account a minimum of 24 hrs prior. So, I made payment in full, which posted a couple days later. I happened to look back at my app and it showed a new balance of {$140.00}. When I called Wells they told me that it was still part of my charges that were posting. I asked why they had all shown posted to my account via my app a full 24 hours prior, why would I still have outstanding transactions. The response was that even though they show posted to my account, it takes 1-3 days to HARD POST. Three separate levels of reps told me this. I asked if the words HARD POST were explained or even present in my Cardmember Agreement, they said it was. Upon a search it was revealed to in fact not be in my agreement and any language could not be found around hard posting times. \\n\\nThis is a deceptive practice, I was presented with a total balance, and confirmation that all transactions had posted, I made payment in full. Then a couple days later, without any further use of my card, I have a new balance. All this activity was well before any statement date, so if I had not done due diligence in checking my account again, I would have interest billed that I was not expecting or planning for. \\n\\nWhen I asked if they thought that was clear to the Customer, I received a canned answer that it is my responsibility to review my statement each time. If I paid my account in full, with all transactions showing posted, and did not use my card further, all before any cycle date, why would i need to review my statement!? As you read this, I hope you can understand my position and why this is totally deceptive. \\n\\nI filed a formal complaint with Wells CASE ID # XXXX', 'Macy\\'s/citibank account : XXXX charges were incurred at some time before this date. payments were not made from XXXX XX/XX/XXXX as this was Fraudulent activity on my account that I was unaware of. In XX/XX/XXXX this was determined to be fraud by Macy\\'s/citibank. When I called on my Macy \\'s account after finding this to be on my credit reports in XXXXXXXX, they transferred me to the debt recovery department. They tell me every time that is was determined to be fraud and I was not liable. Yet- when calling, it says this account is in debt recovery. I asked to speak with someone in the Fraud dept and if transferred am cut off every time, if not transferred I am told to the only way to rectify this is to write a letter only through he USpostal service to rectify and there is no one I can talk to live. This was determined to be Fraud in XX/XX/XXXX. That was nearly 2 years ago and they have not rectified with the Credit reporting agencies- of which it should never have been reported to in the first place. I wrote my letter to request them to rectify in XXXX they stated they only received it on XX/XX/XXXX. The postal service does not take that long. They put this into investigation for the next 30days. If their own Customer Service has stated every time I call that it was determined to be Fraud by their investigation- in XXXX why are they having to further investigate this for 30 days? I have another Citibank Card that will not be reissued- due to this, I have not gotten a loan at an acceptable rate due to this. My credit will take another hit if I have to reapply fort the Citi bank ( Costco ) card that will not be renewed and this is 100 % the Fault of Macy\\'s/citi bank- yet they are saying they need to investigate again!. Why is this allowed? They made the mistake. Then did not fix the mistake. They are taking an additional 30 days to investigate something they got an answer for 2 years ago.

ALL of the transactions have been either near my house, near my work, or online at regularly visited reputable websites like XXXX. I call Capital One, verify my info in excruciating detail, they clear the card and I can use it 1-3 times and it gets locked up for fraud alert even using it at the exact same merchants. I call Capital One, spend approximately 50 minutes on the phone each time, have to verify all info including taking photos of my driver \\'s license which I think is very unsafe. This process repeats every day or few days. Not once during this three week period has there been even one fraudulent charge. I have asked Capital One to fix this problem and have been told there is no one there I can contact nor is there anyone there that can fix my problem. I requested a replacement card initially thinking I might have a problem with my chip. Afterwards it began giving problems for online ( i.e. not swiped ) transactions so I am not thinking this will help. Regardless, they sent a card taking over a week with the EXACT same expiration date and security code. If Capital One is so worried about possible fraudulent charges that they lock up the card almost every day, why would they send the exact same card? Answer is they are incompetent. I feel like I am being harassed by Capital One with this terrible customer service. I feel like I should be compensated for my time, inconvenience and embarrassment of having my card constantly declined. I easily have over ten hours of time invested in this issue. Capital One has consistently stated that every merchant has sent them the wrong information. Really??? 20+ merchants sent the wrong information? I don\\'t think so. They also can\\'t explain if that was the case how on websites where the info is saved ( like XXXX ) the exact same info will work once after they reset the account but the next time the account is locked up. The incompetence at Capital One in regards to this technical issue would be laughable if it weren\\'t such a huge inconvenience.\\n\"Applied for the credit card below with the new card sing up bonus was not given one.

On the website it shows that 3 of the payments I have given them have all been rejected by according to the company by my banks. I have never had any payments rejected by my banks, and if you look at my bank statements this company has never even sent a payment request to my banks. I get a notice on my bank accounts when someone tries to take a payment, it will show as pending, then paid or returned by my banks. In no way shape or form has this company ever showed up as either one of them in my bank accounts.

I got a promotional check for a balance transfer with a 0 % interest till XXXX of XXXX. I\\'m including three statements which clearly shows I paid my new purchase balance, fees for the use of the loan, ( which I understood and agreed to pay ) and payment on the loan delivered on XX/XX/XXXX which needed to be paid on XX/XX/XXXX. When my XXXX Statement arrived I was surprised to see I was being charged and interest fee. When I called the credit card company they said I didn\\'t pay my balance in full. I explained to them I did but your including the loan balance as a total new balance with my new purchases for the month. What good is the 0 % interest till XXXX of XXXX if you include this as part of my new balance and charge me 25 % interest? I kept getting the run around about their policy, so I told them fine I\\'ll just pay the entire amount off which I did shown on the second statement delivered XX/XX/XXXX that was over 2 weeks early as payment was due on XX/XX/XXXX. So you can imagine my surprise when my XXXX statement arrived and I had another interest charge. I then recalled the company and asked them why are they keep charging me interest as I paid my entire balance in full over 2 weeks earlier then it was due. They kept on the same statement that this was due to me not paying my balance in full. I asked the customer service rep if he agreed that I paid my new purchases in full every month and he said yes. I then asked him if I paid my minimum amount due on the loan and he said yes. So then help me understand what I haven\\'t paid? He didn\\'t have a response for me other than I hadn\\'t paid my balance in full. Really because it\\'s clear that I did. I think this 0 % balance transfer program is a scam and I\\'m requesting the interest charges for both months and the fee I paid to have this Credited back to my account as a total of {$57.00} as I did not get the service I was promised. Before I decided to take advantage of this balance transfer I called the credit card company and asked how this all works and they told me, ( which was a recorded line ), that my everyday charges would be separate from my balance transfer and as long as I paid my new purchases in full and the minimum requirement on the loan I would not be charged interest. This is obviously not the case. When I found this service to report this issue I read of another person with a case number XXXX submitted on XX/XX/XXXX with the same issue from the same credit card bank. Got me to thinking how many others are out there getting ripped off by this so called 0 % loan. This is very unethical and I hope you can put a stop to this companies actions as to me this is what is upsetting me more.

XXXX at Iron Capital then said that we already sign the agreement for the {$30000.00} and because we ask him to stop ; we will be responsible to pay the full 15 % on {$30000.00} if it comes up short. He also advised that he could liquidate the credit cards to cash for us if that would make things better. I call to speak with XXXX but now I was given a XXXX and was told this is whom I will be speaking to. I told him that we told XXXX to stop and I will pay him the 15 % on the {$30000.00} whether or not and I don\\'t want the cards to be liquidated. He advised that he will be taking over from here and I believed that he understood what a nightmare this has become and I \\'\\' m ready to pay up what ever has been approved and for how much. XXXX kept calling to find out if any other credit card has been approved which I advise him that I was not hearing nothing else from the others that they said they had sent request to. I told them that I haven\\'t heard anything from whatever bank they claim they had also sent request to and I am done and ready to pay for what I had agreed on. \\n\\nThe total credit cards that were approved was {$33000.00}, XXXX XXXX more than what I requested but I settled to pay them and gave them {$4900.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. Then I was told by XXXX that I still need to follow up on others that they had sent out request to. I advised him that I don\\'t want anymore and that I paid for the amount that I requested and I do not want anymore. I also advised them that if these come through they can close them because I don\\'t need more than what I requested. He then had an XXXX followed up with me for a few weeks to see if they had hit. I was honest and told them they are approved but I won\\'t be needing it and I don\\'t want anymore credit card and that they got paid as per our agreement. Now they start calling me to tell me that must pay them {$3300.00} for the overage that I distinctly told them I don\\'t want. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from an attorney advising that he is collecting a debt for breach of contract with Iron Capital. I advised him that I paid Iron Capital for the agreed amount and whatever the overage is .... \\'\\' I do not want and Iron Capital is aware of it \\'\\'. I told him the amount I paid as per our agreement which he had no knowledge of. He thought that I requested this amount and now I didn\\'t want to pay Iron Capital. I even told him that I will give them a {$1000.00} more to get them off my back and still close the accounts that I don\\'t want. I have told them numerous times that I do not need the extra and I told him that I had told them that I will close out the accounts and they threatened me that no matter if I closed the account I am still responsible to pay for the overage which was not part of the agreement. He advised that he will speak with them. Later that day he called me back and said that they refused the {$1000.00} and they want instead of the {$3300.00} ... {$2900.00} which I did not accept. I felt that they are scamming me to pay for something I do not want. I told him that they are using the agreement from the first loan to try and get money from me for the overage. I now understand why the agreement never printed out the amount requested because when you sent out request to credit card companies, you do not know what the amount approval will be and if its over the amount you requested then they will use that agreement as a breach of contract to get the overage paid. Unfortunately, I was a customer that only needed {$30000.00} and nothing more. This is their scam and the attorney called me back again that day and told me that they sent something to him saying that I put N/A for amount requested which I know I did not, no one in their right mind would do that. I told him that that not true. No one request a loan without putting down the amount of the loan they are requesting and their salary amount which is not on the agreement that I filled out. I looked back on the agreement to see what the attorney was talking about. In the area where it says business information, I N/A everything out because it was not a business loan, it was a personal loan and I had filled out the amount requested and the salary amount on the first page of the agreement. How would you apply for a loan without stating your salary and your loan amount. The lawyer \\'s response was, \"\" he understood my situation but at the same time he doesn\\'t \\'\\' and I asked him ... what if someone was trying to scam money from you? His reply was ... \\'\\' this is about you and not about me \\'\\'. This is wrong and its a scam. No one needs to be harassed and threatened to pay for something they don\\'t want.\"\\nThis bank is horibke Im a loyal Credit card holder but at the time I applied I did not qualify and was told a secured card would be a good option Ive opened it and keep it in good standing pay on time and its over a year and they wont graduate my account and refund me My deposit they lied to me\\nAs I logged in to the PayPal app, I noticed that there was a transaction that I didnt authorized, so I opened a dispute with PayPal so that the transaction can be cancelled.

I trusted their recommendation. They did not disclose to me any of the exorbitant rates or deferred interest penalties. Assume they just wanted to sell me the merchandise without concern for the bank \\'s known unscrupulous methods. I now see this bank has that track record. \\nAt the end of the recent loan period, they just added {$6800.00} to the original balance. This is almost 50 percent of the cost of the original furnace/AC. \\nYesterday, I paid off the residual balance to Synchrony Bank ( principal only - not the interest ). The interest rate they are charging is 26.99 percent. Also, they calculate the interest going back to the beginning of loan period - and charge that rate on the entire beginning balance. \\nI learned about this yesterday, I was paying the monthly amounts electronically. Since I chose to avoid monthly statements, I was paying all amounts electronically. \\nNote : If they had sent me a balloon payment balance of what was left, I would have realized it and paid it immediately. This is extremely deceptive. They deliberately keep the customer in the dark. This also occurred just when the COVID lockdown started in California. \\nI received no warnings or alerts of the end of the 18 month period. \\nNote : This ending period of the loan fell squarely into the first month of COVID XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX. \\nI had recently lost a family member.

The store never told me that the monthly payment are {$76.00} and that payment aren't fixed.

XXXX of XXXX, I became critically ill with XXXX   and nearly died. I had 4 lengthy hospitalizations between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. When I was well enough mentally to contact my creditors, I immediately explained my situation and requested assistance through their hardship programs, where I would have the option of keeping my accounts open and in good standing. All other creditors offered a program, where they lower my interest, waive any late fees or over the limit fees, and reported my accounts in good standing with the credit bureaus. Not Capital one. They make it sound like they are there to help and have only the best of intentions to help you in your time of need. They do not. Since I have entered the hardship program, they sent me notice of default on my accounts, and threatened to cancel my accounts, reported me as much as 120 days late on all 3 of my accounts all while being enrolled in the hardship program. My understanding of this program was if I could not make a payment for a certain time frame, I would be protected while enrolled. If at any time I could make a {$25.00} payment to prevent further issues, that was acceptable. My understanding of their hardship program was to help people. NOT DESTROY their credit. I had an excellent payment history with all of my credit cards with them, but this just completely ruined me. They also did not explain in any way, that after you get caught up on your accounts while on the hardship program-that they then restrict your account for another 3 months-and still continue to report you late to the credit bureaus. I had reached out on SEVERAL occasions to inquire about changing my payment due date to coincide with my SSDI benefits, so that I could make sure my payments were made in a timely fashion and without having trouble paying. They flat out refused ( after telling me on more than one occasion they could change my billing date ). They claim payment due dates can not be changed while enrolled in a hardship program. How is that supposed to help me? It does NOT, it hinders my ability to make timely payments as agreed once I entered into the hardship program. Despite being caught up since XXXX, they have restricted my cards for 3 additional months, in which they STILL REFUSE to change my billing date. How can this even be considered a program to HELP ANYONE but themselves? When they offered insurance for this type of scenario, I always had payment protection on all of my cards specifically for issues like this, but they eliminated all programs to actually HELP people. I had filed a complaint with the XXXX  but all they did was have someone from corporate call and apologize to me and again go over the terms of the hardship program. NO help at all.\\nCapital One Card is showing a missed payment from XX/XX/2018 - payment was not missed or notified of missed payment.\\n\"On XX/XX/XXXX my fiancee and I went to the Zales store in XXXX County in the Mall. We purchased a diamond engagement ring in excess of {$5000.00} and applied for a store credit card for {$3000.00}. We financed {$3000.00} of the ring and paid cash for the remainder. We have made our payments and have paid over {$2000.00} in payments over 2 years. The last time I looked at my balance it was under {$2000.00}. We kept making payments and just last week my husband was going to purchase a birthday gift for me and it said he had no credit which was alarming which in turn encouraged me to go online ( that\\'s how we pay monthly ) and pull the full statement to see what was wrong. It was then I noticed we had been charged over {$80.00} a month in interest and a fee of {$1200.00} on XX/XX/XXXX when our balance shows was {$1900.00}. I called the store to inquire as to what was going on since I know we paid over {$2000.00} in payments already. They told us today that we had a promotional credit card with no interest for 18 months. Without any disclosure to us that on XX/XX/XXXX we would incur a fee int he amount of {$1200.00} for back interest. As we have been paying the bill monthly we saw interest coming out monthly but all of a sudden our balance shot back up to the original purchase amount. I attempted to resolve this with Comenity Bank/Zales and they were very rude and accused me of not making myself aware and checking my statements monthly. They asked for a manager and was given \"\" XXXX \\'\\' and she was increasingly frustrating to talk with. Very short, rude and accusatory blaming us for the misunderstanding. Of course, we assume it is written in fine print somewhere but it was never disclosed verbally to us that had we not paid the purchase off in full in 18 months that we would be charged back interest at over 29 %. To us we feel extremely violated and robbed of our hard earned money. We are paying this card off immediately but felt it necessary to make the Federal Trade Commission aware of their misleading advertising and clear disclosure of such a scam. \\n\\nThank you for your time and consideration.

Thank you', 'Capital One closed my credit card account. They did so without advance notice. The account was current with a balance of {$53.00}. The closure shows up on my credit report as account closed by credit grantor which caused a significant drop in my credit score. This drop is now affecting my ability to get a mortgage as well as the interest rate that I will potentially qualify for. So, there are real damages to their actions. \\nIt took me five calls and four days to get in contact with someone at capital one to discuss this. I originally learned about it from an alert sent by my credit score monitoring company that notified me of a status change for one of my accounts ( Cap One account now showed as \"\" Closed by Credit Grantor \\'\\' ) and a 38-point decline in my credit score. At this point, I had not been notified by Capital One and I had no idea what was causing the closure of my account. After several days of contacting Cap One, trying to find out why. Each time being told that their customer service people had no information. And the only way I could find out anything was to leave a message with some obscure department that does not answer calls. It took four attempts to get connected and to leave a message. Four days later, I received a call from someone from their executive resolution team. XXXX ID # XXXX, spoke with me on a recorded line. And basically, told me nothing. The woman read from a letter which, by her own admission had not been sent to me yet. Amazing!! The letter stated something to the effect that management closed my account because they were not happy with my usage patterns. I don\\'t use the card much. And I pay it off as soon as I do. Obviously, I am not a meaningful customer to them, because I do not generate interest charges or fees. Furthermore, when I asked the person who called me If I could speak to her manager or any person of authority at Capital One. She gave her managers name but would not give his ID number and said she would not allow me to speak with him. She told me that closing the account was within their rights as per the cardmember agreement. Repeating that statement as well as other jarred answers. Telling me there was no one else to speak with and she could be no further help. I then asked for who I could write to or call. She told me my only recourse was to write a letter and send it to the general correspondence PO box . I then asked who regulated them, which she did not initially know. She paused and had to investigate. She also was unable to direct me on how to contact their regulator and make a formal complaint. She later directed me the CFPB but did now know how to contact the bureau. \\nThe fact that they managed this process so poorly is not my primary concern. Although I think it should concern the CFPB. I don\\'t need the account. My issue is that they could have simply given me the opportunity to close it on my own for a period of time, before doing so themselves. Or report it to the credit bureau in such a way that was not so damaging to my credit profile.

It is the most courteous consumer benefit which separates American Express with most other banks. \\n-I have always enjoyed this feature, many times if i needed to make a purchase above my current available credit and also take advantage of my rewards points. I could simply make the required payment amount and use the card for the purchase immediately. \\n-On XX/XX/XXXX ; I made a payment for {$1900.00}, not a large amount of money. Immediately as it has always done, my available credit increased to reflect the payment amount. That being {$1900.00} ( credit limit is {$6000.00} ). \\n-I then attempted to pay my ATT bill for {$950.00} and was declined. Soon after my available credit was removed. \\n-Used the American Express Chat feature, spent over an hour hearing the AMEX rep. Lie to me time after time. Finally a supervisor came on and confirmed the information I was provided earlier was untruthful. \\n-I attempted another payment for {$500.00} just to prove my account had been restricted. Again the payment was not credited. \\n-Therefore I contacted my bank to make sure those payments are not honored, American Express I have recordings and copies of my chat conversations which will clearly confirm all my claims\"\\nHome Depot credit card offered by Citi Bank advertise a promotion of 6 months interest free on balances but when promotion expired company charged deferred interest to my account. Large lump-sum interest was added to my account. This practice should be illegal. How are they allowed to do this after what happened with the financial market back in 2009?\\nSynchrony Bank via their XXXX store card ending in XXXX placed a {$130.00} charge on the XXXX card account in XX/XX/XXXX to pay for XXXX XXXX without my knowledge or consent. They later marked the account as delinquent in payment which damaged my credit score. During a phone call with their representative in XX/XX/XXXX they agreed to rescind their late fees, pay off XXXX XXXX using an account of my choosing, and cancel the card. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX cancelled my XXXX account and the {$130.00} charge on the card. On XX/XX/XXXX Synchrony Bank billed my selected account {$130.00} despite the fact that XXXX cancelled all existing charges on the store card ending in XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX after discussions over the phone with XXXX and Synchrony Bank, Synchrony Bank agreed to refund {$130.00} via a mailed check to cover their charge made to my account which should not have been made.\\n\"I have now had two calls with Chase bank over this issue. The first was on Friday, XX/XX/2020 at XXXX XXXX, lasting 37 minutes and 26 seconds. The second was on Wednesday, XX/XX/2020 at XXXX XXXX, lasting 1 hour, 18 minutes, and 18 seconds. I have been told Chase is unable to provide additional assistance with resolving the issue, which I do not believe to be true. \\n\\nOn Friday, XX/XX/2020, I attempted to create an online account for my new credit card. When I created my account, I received a two-factor authentication request with an authentication sent to a phone number I did not recognize. I had to call in to the online support team in order to gain access to my account, as I was unable to authenticate. Once I was in the account, and over the course of my conversation with support, I could see the primary number associated with my account was the aforementioned number I was not associated with. My phone number, the number I used in my application for the credit card, was listed as the secondary number. The support employee removed the incorrect phone number listed as primary before I had a chance to write down the number, but I believe it to have ended to the effect of XXXX. She escalated the issue to an investigator who was supposed to call me back on Wednesday, XX/XX/2020. \\n\\nI received a call-back from the investigator on Wednesday XX/XX/2020 who could not provide any additional information as to why the number was associated with my account. As it was a credit card issue, she transferred me to the credit card team. The credit card team employee I spoke with could not assist me, and escalated me to his supervisor. His supervisor said it appeared to be fraud to him, and transferred me to the fraud team. The fraud team said they did not see any evidence of another number existing on my account, and suggested transferring me to another team. I was then transferred back to the online account team. The online account team transferred me back to the credit card team. I was then escalated to a supervisor on the credit card team, who escalated me up another level to someone with elevated access. \\n\\nThe person I was escalated to was unable to help me understand why that number was associated with my account, and was able to confirm I do not have any other associations with Chase Accounts ( which is not a surprise to me, as I have not had a Chase account ). I had heard from her, and a couple of other employees, that having another Chase account could have caused the system to associate a primary number on those accounts to this new credit card, but that does not appear to be the case. I also correctly input my phone number when I initially submitted my application, another common cause of error, as my phone number was correct and associated with the account - as its primary number. \\n\\nI believe having a primary number associated with my account that I did not add, and should not have been associated with my account to begin with, to be a significant privacy and account security risk. I was not provided an explanation as to why this may have occurred. I was transferred in a circle, and transferred/escalated a total of 8 times over the course of an hour and a half, with not a single employee able to assist me. I was finally told by the employee with elevated privileges that there was no-one she could transfer me to that could assist in investigating the root cause of this number association.\"\\nOn XX/XX/2019, an unauthorized charge of {$100.00} was made from Best Buy to my Citi Mastercard.

My intentions with this line of credit was to transfer an existing Barclay balance onto this new card with a 0 % APR. I was very specific about my intentions and verbally stated them multiple times to multiple agents on the phone. Upon hearing my request the agent offered to open me a card. I told her I would only open the account with the pre mentioned stipulation ( the balance transfer ) as a guarantee. It was at this time the agent fraudulently opened the card in my name. Only after my credit was pulled and everything was finalized was I told Barclay does not even consider transferring balances from an existing barclaycard to a new one. They knew this as fact, and in a predatory manner, manipulated me into opening this account anyway. I immediately demanded a supervisor review the recorded phone call of my application and reverse all actions made. I was told the call would be immediately reviewed and I would be contacted back within 24 to 48 hours. After waiting an entire week to hear back from some sort of supervisor within their company, I was finally contacted and notified that they do not listen to recorded phone calls of applications, nor would they be able to do anything about the fraudulent account being opened. This is a predatory and manipulative process that they are putting people through. I can't see how it is legally possible for them to continue to do business the way that they are.\", 'greetings my name is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and onXX/XX/2019 I attempted to apply for a new credit card because I frequently watch my score and I felt I was good.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I initiated a {$4700.00} balance transfer from my BoA account to my XXXX XXXX account. The transfer posted to my BoA account on XX/XX/XXXX. I also had autopay setup through BoA \\'s bill pay system, and it autodrafted my previous account balance of {$4400.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. This meant my XX/XX/XXXX BoA statement had a New Balance Total of - {$4300.00} with a Minimum Payment Due of {$0.00} by XX/XX/XXXX. The Important Messages section on Page 4 of the statement clearly says \"\" You have a credit balance and do not need to make a payment on your account. \\'\\' I did not routinely check my BoA account or bank account after verifying the balance transfer had posted, so when I noticed this draft from my bank account I was very upset and called BoA. They indicated they had no control over the e-bill system and didn\\'t know what had happened. I requested they refund the payment, which they finally did on XX/XX/XXXX. I verified the money was back in my bank account and didn\\'t think anything else needed to be done. On XX/XX/XXXX, I tried to use my BoA card online and it was denied. When I logged into my account, it showed my account was past due and that I had missed a payment. I double checked my XXXX statement and verified it showed {$0.00} minimum payment due by XX/XX/XXXX. At this point I was very upset, so rather than call BoA I used their online chat system. I believe the representative I dealt with was XXXX. She initially said I\\'d missed a payment, then after 30 minutes of back and forth explaining the situation to her, she credited the {$25.00} missed payment fee, and said she had fixed the account. \\n\\nI assumed the issue was taken care of until I tried to use my card online today and it was once again denied. This time I called BoA and had to go through the whole scenario again. The first rep explained that I\\'d missed a payment in XXXX that was caused by BoA refunding my XXXX payment. I explained my XXXX statement shows there is {$0.00} due so there was no way I could have missed a payment. I finally asked to speak to her supervisor. The supervisor looked at the account, noted that the {$25.00} had been credited on XX/XX/XXXX, but then said I should have made a minimum payment in XXXX and that there was nothing she could do about it other than take a payment today. I once again pointed out the XXXX statement and she told me that you have to make a payment every month, which is ludicrous.', 'I called the US Bank Credit card number on XX/XX/2019 to see about lowering my interest rate ( now north of 23 % ). I asked them if they would change my card to a platinum card instead of a travel rewards, that way they can still make money and I save some. The usurious rate that they are charging should be illegal. 23 % I so much that I couldnt possibly dent it properly. Im not asking them to close the card, Im asking them to not charge an arm and a leg, specially when rates right now are so low. It seems completely abusive and I believe the cfpb needs to be made aware of that these big banks are doing to their regular consumers. They said no. That there was no invitation for me to lower my rate right now. I explained how it would be smart to do this cause I could get a balance transfer and terminate my relationship with them. They still said no. They will charge me 23.99 % on a {$14000.00} balance. Which is fantastic for them!

I specifically told them that I was NOT disputing that I made the charge, but instead that I never RECEIVED any product. On XXXX, the company credited my account for {$140.00}. Then, I got a letter from them on XX/XX/XXXX, stating they would remove the credit given on XX/XX/XXXX, with the following documents supporting their case : A receipt from XXXX showing my order, a USPS tracking receipt from a XXXX company, and finally a receipt from the XXXX company stating that I purchased \"\" ( 1 ) decompression fingertip toys front and rear shock absorber larg-black advanced version \\'\\' weighing 0.05 Kg with a value of {$5.00} XXXX.

I never heard from them for several weeks. Then I called XXXX again to ask if they got my faxed documents, and the agent said no they did not. She gave me a new address to send my documents to : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, FL XXXX. I sent all the documents they had originally sent me, along with their letters from XXXX and XXXX XXXX. I sent a filled out and signed Dispute Acknowledgement Form. I sent them the document from USPS of XXXX XXXX, Texas showing the item was delivered to XXXX XXXX. Additionally, I sent them a copy of my credit card statement with the closing date of XX/XX/XXXX. On this statement, I circled the entree for XX/XX/XXXX where they had credited my account {$140.00}, and I circled the entree where they had debited my account {$140.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. I wrote a note stating that the USPS did not deliver the product to my home ever, and besides, the item they delivered to the wrong address was a fidget spinner basically, weighing only 0.5 kg. I ordered an adult motorized scooter also, I said, and the XXXX receipt did not reflect that, and the value was US {$5.00} on the receipt, not {$140.00} US. I received 2 emails from XXXX XXXX saying they were looking into the dispute. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from XXXX XXXX stating that, according to their records, a credit of {$140.00} was applied to my account on XX/XX/XXXX. Well, as you can see, they did not acknowledge that that {$140.00}, on XX/XX/XXXX, was debited to my account. This is the same statement with the closing date of XX/XX/XXXX that I sent XXXX XXXX  a copy of with those dates circled to clarify the situation. \\n\\nIn conclusion, I have phoned the company over 7 times, chatted online with them on numerous occasions, and faxed and mailed documents repeatedly, and they REFUSE to give me my {$140.00} back.', 'First problem is that this company stole my money : XX/XX/2020 Posted date XX/XX/2020 Merchant info XXXX DescriptionXXXX  MethodOnline, mail or phone Card number ( ...

I am not getting anything from the fraudulent company. Chase is NOT responding to my emails and when I talk to customer service they are extremely rude. I have not received a credit from Chase and they are not investigating. \\n\\nSecond problem, back in XX/XX/XXXX I sent about {$600.00} to XXXX via Chase. XXXX says they never got the money from Chase. Chase claims they sent it. Again, I lost {$600.00} due to Chase being inept.\"\\nAccount were paid up to date and the account still shows negative on my credit report.\\n\"I have been a customer of JPMorgan Chase for about 8 years and I have never missed a payment or been overdrafted on my account. Moreover, I have other accounts in other XXXX financial institutions with longer credit history, and I am proud to say that I have always maintained an impeccable record. \\n\\n\\nMy credit score is around 800 or upper 700s, which has taken me a lifetime to build. I am also a homeowner and have never missed a mortgage payment. My total credit line is about {$400000.00}. \\n\\n\\nAnother thing I should point out is that all direct deposits from my job and my wifes job go to Chase and all bill pays are associated with Chase. So Chase is able to see exactly where our money is coming from and where it is going and we have proof for all of our charges if necessary. \\n\\n\\nHere is the nightmare we find ourselves in. I reluctantly opened another credit card with Chase to take advantage of a rewards offer from the XXXX card and to use it for traveling. A few weeks after receiving the card, I purchased a watch for my wife with this card in the city we live in ( XXXX, WI ). It was a big purchase and the only reason I used this card was because you have to spend {$4000.00} in the first three months to get a {$500.00} dollar reward. \\n\\n\\nThat charge and future charges did not go through and my credit card was blocked. They did not call me to verify the purchases, they just blocked my account. I called Chase and no one would help me because my account was blocked. On Monday, I went to a Chase branch and they were trying to help me fix the situation. My Chase branch didnt know why my account was red flagged, so they called the main offices. Turns out that they closed ALL of my Chase accounts. \\n\\n\\nNo notice, no explanation, and nothing I could do. Just like that, all these years of working hard to build my credit score and now, having a perfect record goes out the window when my wife and I did absolutely nothing wrongand did everything right. \\n\\n\\nNot only that they closed my accounts, but the person that did this did not even review my Credit Bureau score. My guess is that he saw my XXXX name and made a biased decision. Had he checked, he would have realized that I have a perfect record and there are XXXX issues with my wifes nor my account or in any other aspects of our lives. They did not even abide by the know your customer law. In fact, it looks like they are abusing this law in order to discriminate against us and everything we have worked so hard for. \\n\\n\\nAgain, my wife and I have a perfect record ( not even a speeding ticket ). The only difference is that my wife is a U.S. citizen and I am a green card holder.\\n\\nAt first, the person in charge of the fraud department said that my accounts will be closed and they will not be reviewing it further. After they realized they messed up and that we have an impeccable record, they said they will do another review, but there is no guarantee that anything will be reopened and that it will take 10 business days. At any rate, it is already too late because the Credit Bureau will be notified, and weve been panicking making sure we dont miss any bills. My wife is a teacher at an  elementary school and has said that she teaches her students that if they work hard and take care of their responsibilities, they will be able to accomplish their dreams. We worked hard and took care of all of our responsibilities and instead of all our hard work paying off, we are being targeted simply because of my name. \\n\\n\\nWhat JPMorgan Chase has done to us is completely unacceptable and they should be held accountable for their actions. It has caused a lot of stress to me and my family. It will take decades to repair the damage that Chase has caused us with just a click of a button -- with no valid reasons. \\n\\n\\nAttached are the following : - proof that my accounts have been closed - current balance in my checking account - receipt of Rolex watch purchased on XX/XX/19 at XXXX - receipt of XXXX watch purchased on XX/XX/19 on XXXX - receipt of airplane tickets bought on XX/XX/19', 'I dont recall this account ever being late.

This is my correspondence with Navy Federal Messaging service. \\n\\nSubject : Credit Card Denial Your Message XX/XX/2019 : Which is it? First you say it\\'s my credit limited credit history, but I quickly disproved that. Now, you say it\\'s all of these other things, that can also be disproven. \\nWith an XXXX credit score with XXXX, a household income of {$170000.00}, and 15+ years of credit history ; I find your explanation hard to believe.\\n\\nWith an XXXX  credit score with XXXX, a household income of {$170000.00}, and 15+ years of credit history ; I find your explanation hard to believe. \\nI know my credit repayment history ( excellent ), my debt to income ratio ( XXXX ), credit utilization, ( XXXX  ), payment history ( 100 % on time ), Derogatory remarks ( none )! This leads me to believe your internal lending guidelines has race criteria and it was used in evaluating my application. If this was not the case, my caucasian friend, another applicant, who has half of my credit history, significantly less income, credit score, and terrible payment history, would have been denied credit as well, but not only approved, but given a {$25000.00} \"\" unsecured \\'\\' credit limit. This is discrimination all day and it\\'s common practice for lending institutions, like yours, to rely of your \"\" internal \\'\\' lending guidelines to secretly discriminate. Complaints will be filed! No further actions or communication is required on your part.\\n\\nNavy Federal Response XX/XX/2019 : Thank you for your response. Like most financial institutions, we have adopted a rate scale which assigns rates based on specific risk factors that include income, credit repayment history with both Navy Federal and other lenders, debt-to-income ratio, and credit utilization. As part of this process, lenders may choose from different credit models that are available from the credit bureaus. Lenders will pick the model that they feel best suits their financial need. Therefore, the score that we obtain may differ from that of other financial institutions, or those obtained directly from the bureaus. A letter has been issued to you via mail with your Navy Federal score and additional information in regards to your application decision. \\n\\nAlthough we can not provide your with our internal lending guidelines, we can advise that based on the limited credit history provided by XXXX, we are unable to grant an unsecured credit card at this time. \\n\\nIf you have any further questions or concerns, please let us know. \\n\\n\\n\\nYour Message XX/XX/2019 : What exactly is a \"\" Navy Federal Credit Score \\'\\' and where can I find this score? I am aware of XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX, but didn\\'t know about Navy Federal.  What are your minimum guidelines for credit? I have 14+ years of credit history, what is the standard? \\n\\n\\n\\nNavy Federal Response XX/XX/2019 : Thank you for your message. We have conducted a second review of your application. Unfortunately, based on our lending criteria, your Navy Federal credit score does not meet the minimum guideline for credit at this time due to limited credit history. Although this request has been denied, it does not mean that future requests will be disapproved. Navy Federal evaluates each credit card application using the same lending criteria. Navy Federal does not discriminate and did not do so in this case. \\n\\nIf you would like additional information regarding the credit bureau information used in our decision, you may contact XXXX XXXX at XXXX. Navy Federal obtained your credit information on the date of XX/XX/XXXX. Please provide this date to XXXX XXXX in order to receive the most accurate information. \\nIf you have any questions, please let us know. \\n\\n\\n\\nYour Message XX/XX/2019 : I just applied for a credit card with an excellent credit score and over $ XXXX a year in income. If I didn\\'t think I would be approved for this card, I would not have applied. ( Hard credit inquiries ) My race wouldn\\'t have anything to do with that .... would it? My XXXX  friend, who told me about the card, just applied and was quickly approved. What\\'s going on? There is no need for me to wait on a letter explaining you denial of my application, this is ridiculous and unacceptable!', 'To Whom it may concern : In XX/XX/2019 I moved to XXXX, the XXXX for a new job. In XX/XX/2019, I lost my wallet. I called all of my credit card companies and reported that I had lost my wallet. With some of the companies, I had no issue getting a new credit card sent to my new address in XXXX and others I had a little more trouble with. Since my TD Bank credit card was one that I had trouble receiving at my new address, I figured that I\\'d wait until I returned back to the US to pick the credit card up then. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/2019, I called into TD bank to have my card mailed to my US address so that I would be able to pick it up from my house while home for XXXX. \\nUpon speaking with an agent they informed me that TD bank had closed my card and would not be reissuing me a new one. I then spoke to the \"\" supervisor on duty \\'\\' who informed me that TD had chosen to not reissue my card due to the card not being used enough. When I explained that I had lost the card when I first moved overseas he simply stated he was sorry and that if I want the card back that I would need to reapply. \\n\\nI\\'m writing this complaint because I believe my card was unjustly shut down. I\\'m still making payments on the card, I like the credit card and the fact that I haven\\'t \"\" used it in a long time \\'\\' seems like a very soft reason to shut it down. Furthermore, how do you expect someone to use their credit card if you don\\'t ship it to their address outside of the country? \\n\\nI have the police report from the city of XXXX and will be submitting a copy in order to corroborate this information. Again, I feel as though my credit card account was unjustly shut down and would like to have it reopened. \\n\\nThank you for your time, XXXX XXXX', 'Citibank hold the funds received through a refund from the merchant starting XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/2019. \\n\\nIt was refunded only when I called-in to get it refunded back to me. \\n\\nThe amount was {$70.00}. \\nCredit Card # XXXX The bank is following malpractices and unethical and is trying to usurp the customer \\'s money.\"\\n, On XX/XX/2019 I noticed there was pending charge of a linked external account into my account i was not aware about. The charge was in the amount of {$9000.00} I contacted Blue Bird by american express they said they will try and cancel the transaction and contact the bank it was linked to. They put account under dispute and said investigation takes 10 business days. On XX/XX/2019 which was the 10 business day i contacted them around XXXX XXXX. They said i had to wait till the end of the day for a response of my dispute. They sent me an email at at XXXX ; XXXX that my dispute for the {$9000.00} dollars was declined from American Express Prepaid Card because based on their investigation they determined no error occurred and that the transaction was authorized. I have no link accounts to my prepaid I have been saving all year all banks if you are going to do a big transaction will contact you this bank did not do anything to help me from identity theft In addition I have contacted all 3 credit bureaus. I have contacted the police for Identity Theft. I had to change all passwords. The bank does not want to give me any information about the linked account nor where it comes from. they said to send a letter and they will help in the matter I really hope me writing to their fraud Department it will make a difference .They hung up the phone on me the last 3 times i contacted On XX/XX/2019. I tried talking to their representative and they put me on hold and then hung up. In addition, it made it more suspicious on their end. I am taking all measures possible I will like the only money to be back into my account. At this point you want to save for a better future and maybe buy a home and I felt as if my money was safe with them and now I am scared to even put XXXX dollars into a bank and wake up and have nothing. My direct deposit I had to cancel as well The agents answering phones were not helpful and just kept saying to wait the 10 days. I have I been a victim of identity theft someone please help me fight this dispute it is very serious and it can jeopardize not only my identity but also my credit. Is Blue Bird american Express a fraud?\\n\"I made a puchase with Lowe \\'s on XX/XX/XXXX in the original amount of {$1400.00} on an 18-month, 0 % interest promotion. My credit card is set to have all payments allocated to promotional balances, first. Steadily, since that purchase, every payment I\\'ve made has been well in excess of {$200.00}, and lately, closer to {$350.00}. {$140.00} of my payment ( approximately ) is first paid to a fixed payment purchase I made earlier in the year. The rest of my payments should go to the promotional balances. On XX/XX/XXXX, this promotion balance ended and I was charged over {$700.00} in interest. When I contacted Lowes on  XX/XX/XXXX, they stated I still had a balance owed on that promotion of {$1100.00}. I requested a review of how each payment I had made since the promotional purchase was applied to my balance. The chat representative said that he could give me the payment allocation over chat, but would not be able to send them to be in the mail or e-mail claiming \"\" security reasons \\'\\' for why he couldn\\'t send it via either of those methods.', 'XX/XX/2019 XXXX Purchase {$570.00} chosen ( 12 ) month interest free. \\nXX/XX/2019 XXXX Refund {$120.00} credit to account for missing parts. \\nXX/XX/2019 FINANCE CHARGE {$12.00} Disputed fees ( 12 ) month interest free. \\nXX/XX/2019 FINANCE CHARGE {$10.00} Disputed fees ( 12 ) month interest free. \\nXX/XX/2019 FINANCE CHARGE {$10.00} Disputed fees ( 12 ) month interest free. \\nXX/XX/2019 FINANCE CHARGE {$9.00} Disputed fees ( 12 ) month interest free. \\n\\nXX/XX/2019 Opened a dispute with Comenity Bank, issuer XXXX XXXX. \\n\\nComenity Bank alleges, that option for ( 12 ) month interest free would have been available at checkout.\\n\\nCustomer, alleges that option was chosen as only two options we\\'re presented at checkout.

They sent a message after the fact which also stated that I could have my limit returned to the original if I called the company. When I called, I was informed that reducing my credit limit would adversely affect my credit score. I was placed on hold for 17 minutes before I hung up and called back and spoke to \"\" XXXX in XXXX \\'\\'. She informed me that there is a clause in my agreement that allows them to increase my credit limit. It is a feature that I could turn off ; which I did. However, I did not reduce my limit to avoid the penalty to my credit score.I was then turned over to a supervisor who quoted the policy a number of times. \\n\\nI simply would have liked a notification prior to the increase so I could make a decision about my own finances. This is a form of fraud to me because they increase their value through our fractional lending system without actually having the money to back up what could negatively affect my credit. According to my financial adviser, I need at least two credit cards to increase my credit score. This increase can have negative consequences in my getting approved for that second card.\"\\nI was charged {$190.00} or a freezer I did not order that was delivered by XXXX to someone I do not know at an address I have never been to. I filed a notice of fraud with Bank of America but they concluded the charge was consistent with my transactions. I appealed the decision by going to the bank personally but all the manger did was call the credit card fraud line even though I provided a document showing the delivery occurred to an address amount XXXX miles from my home. It is true that I purchase merchandise from XXXX but this hardly seems like a reasonable explanation for denying a fraud claim.\\n\"Events in chronological order : ( 1 ) I applied for a citibank credit card \"\" Citi / AAdvantage Platinum Select card \\'\\' on XX/XX/2019, I was notified that the application was approved no later than XX/XX/2019. \\n\\n( 2 ) There is another email saying that I should expect the new card by XX/XX/2019. \\n\\n( 3 ) However I did not receive the card even on XX/XX/2019. Then I contacted customer support online ( live chat ) to ask Citi to resend the new card. The agent said that the card will arrive in 7-10 days. \\n\\n( 4 ) Now today on XX/XX/2019 which is 12 days after the chat I still did not get my new card and I have to call customer support again to ask what happened and how to resolve the issue ( 5 ) After the agent verified all the information and about to place the order to resend the card she said \"\" sorry verification blocked because the account is of high fraudulent risk \\'\\'. I think it\\'s really ridiculous and I don\\'t trust the agent \\'s capability to resolve this issue promptly or smoothly so I am complaining to CFPB about the case. \\n\\nWhat I am complaining for : ( 1 ) It has been almost 1 month after the application is approved I am still far from receiving the actual credit card. \\n\\n( 2 ) I contacted Citibank several times but they failed to process the resending order. \\n\\n( 3 ) The agent said that it\\'s because the address on my profile does not have apartment number. However I checked it again and again, my apartment IS on the profile. I did double check triple check. The agent changed her word after hearing this. \\n\\n( 4 ) The same thing happened to me more than once. Another very important communication from Citibank, which has a {$300.00} check was also not delivered to my address. \\n\\n( 5 ) I really don\\'t understand that why my account was flagged as \"\" high risk of fraudulent \\'\\'. I don\\'t even received my card!!! If that\\'s the reason. This risk is totally brought by Citibank. Think about it, I applied for a new card. It never arrives. I contacted Citibank but they said oh sorry we can\\'t send you the card because of high risk. Isn\\'t this thing totally ridiculous???? Ask yourself.', 'This account was opened in XXXX, 2019. It was used only once to purchase {$45.00} worth of mulch at XXXX XXXX \\'s XXXX, MA location. The account number is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. \\n\\nAfter having not received a bill or the card itself, I called and notified XXXX XXXX that the card was lost or stolen and that no bill had ever been received. \\n\\nI subsequently learned that the statements and card had been sent to a wrong address. Despite several calls, at least four, over the next few months, the address was never corrected properly and statements, or the card, were still not received. \\n\\nIn each of these calls I was told there would be no finance charges or fees. While credits have been put on the account they do not keep up with the finance charges and fees charged which are being levied on finance charges and fees. That should be illegal. \\n\\nI paid the bill in full for the amount of the goods purchased on XX/XX/2019. Their representatives take notes. This is all in their records and was so acknowledged in conversation with me. \\n\\nThe last call was one month ago to point out that the address was still wrong and the interest and fees still on the statement. Again, I was told they would be removed. \\n\\nI also asked that they correct the information being sent, wrongly, to the credit rating agencies. The response was that I should call each of them and dispute the account. When I pointed out that it is their responsibility to fix their errors I was put on hold for a supervisor. I am still waiting. That is the second time that happened, the first was when I called and offered to allow a direct debit to a bank account to pay for the initial charge. Their representative could not tell me what that amount was and put me on hold to wait for a supervisor. I am still waiting. \\n\\nI have endured inept service, a lack of common respect, harassing calls and damage to my credit score. I would like written confirmation that all of this has been corrected, including rectifying the credit bureau reporting. \\n\\nI also sent a letter last month. The answer was non-responsive.\"\\nI was shocked when I reviewed my credit report and found 180 days late payment on the dates XX/XX/2019 to XX/XX/2019. I am not sure how this happened, I believe that I had made my payments to you when I received my statements. My only thought is that my monthly statement did not get to me.\\n\"A new credit card was established around the beginning of XXXX and one transaction of {$32.00} on the XXXX statement. The statement address was incorrect and no statements were received. Multiple late charges and interest amounts were assessed to the account. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I was made aware of the situation and I called in and paid the {$32.00} amount that was charged. In addition, the representative in collections waived all of the late and interest charges on the account. The account was paid in full by the XX/XX/XXXX due date. On XX/XX/XXXX when the next statement closed, there was a {$29.00} late fee that was unjustly charged because the balance was paid in full. Our understanding was that the account was paid in full. The address was still not corrected. \\n\\nWe called back on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with XXXX at US Bank  and he said that not all of the charges were waived like we thought. He said could not waive the other late fees and additional late charges, even after explaining the situation. We still haven\\'t received a statement, but found the statement online. They are charging additional late fees without any justification.\"\\nI would like to file a complaint with the CFPB and add documentation of contracts, commitments, and guarantees I would like to make available against Capital One Bank. The Bank shows recorded on my credit card a single charge of {$7000.00}. I filed my complaint with the Bank XX/XX/2018. My complaint about entry to my statement to the Bank was recorded on XX/XX/2018. The charge recorded as XXXX   XXXX. A five hundred forty day period of time is allowable to back charge the merchant. Banks sometimes claim the can only back charge the merchant for a short amount of time set by bank policy and that policy may be 30 days or sixty days. According to my calculations I am within the time allowable of five hundred forty days. I made my own calculations on my computer and find considering Sundays  seventy seven in number and Holidays up to sixteen days. I have other banks who can back charge merchants and satisfy me to completeness but why can\\'t this Bank? I hear a lot about Consumer Protection but how does this Bank work for me according to Consumer Protection I would like to know. What proof or evidence can this Bank supply me? What means did this Bank use to contact the merchant? What was their response? Did you contact them within the time allowed? How fast did you respond to my complaint? How many times did you try?\\n\"In XX/XX/XXXX, I took a balance transfer from Citicards for {$2400.00} at 0 % interest until XX/XX/2020. The wording of the terms was constructed so that the terms of repayment were at best unclear. Recently, speaking to various Citicards staff, it was now made clear to me that higher interest rate activities would be paid off first on a monthly basis, and the lower rates last. Since my balance transfer has 0 % it receives only the minimum every month. In order for me to pay the transfer by XX/XX/2020, I will need to pay off all purchases and keep only the balance transfer amount so that my payments will be totally applied to reduce the balance. My understanding of the terms was that my monthly payments would be applied to the balance similarly to purchases. When applying for the transfer, their staff reads a script which is technical and wordy distracting your attention and understanding. I can not help but believe that Citicards ( Citicorps ) is engaging in fraud. The purpose of a balance transfer is to payoff other cards and to use just one. Citicards has created a win-win situation. If I use their card, my balance transfer is barely impacted by payments, and in XX/XX/XXXX they can impose their interest.', \"Unrecognized charge on my credit card. I disputed the charge but a month later it was back with a note indicating it was resolved. The note said to go to the communications center for further explanation, which I did but there was nothing there. \\n\\nHours and hours ( literally ) of automated phone system XXXX finally gets me in touch with a person who tells me the same thing. When I ask them to go to the communications center for that further explanation, they can't find it either. So ... \\n\\nTransferred to another person who does the same thing, can't find the 'so-called ' communications except for telling me that I probably got an email with the resolution so it's now my fault ( e.g. no email ever received ). So I asked if they could resend it, which gets me transferred to another department and eventually hung-up on ... again.\", 'XXXX : KOHLS STORE XXXX XXXX EMAIL : XXXX CONTACT PHONE NUMBER XXXX On XX/XX/19 I purchased 2 pieces of jewelry that totalled {$49.00}. I continued shopping and then realized that I did not use a 20 % off coupon that I had. I went back to the jewelry counter and explained this to the clerk. I asked her if she could void the first purchase ( in amount of {$49.00} ) and ring the items through again, applying the 20 % off coupon and she said yes, she was able to do that. The second, correct transaction came to {$30.00}. I received my XXXX statement and both amounts were showing on it - {$49.00} and {$30.00}. I immediately called Kohls and placed a dispute on my account. OnXX/XX/19 I received a letter acknowledging the dispute and advising that I would be contacted with a resolution within 60 days. Yesterday,XX/XX/19 I again called Kohls and spoke to CSR Badge # XXXX. She was clueless, even though I explained the situation to her, which is not odd considering the caliber of customer service that Kohl \\'s continually offers. Customer Service has been an ongoing problem, I am not sure what causes the sub-standard customer service with Kohls but it is a repeated, ongoing problem. Nobody understand the situation even though it has been explained to them repeatedly AND all of the notes are clearly in my file. \\n\\nCSR Badge # XXXX did not understand what I was saying and obviously she lacked the skills to read the file and figure out what was going on. I then spoke to Manager Badge # XXXX, XXXX, who was just as, if not more clueless than previous CSR. He kept telling me there was no \"\" duplicate charge \\'\\' - even though the original complaint included the facts, that the second transaction was done because I did not use a 20 % off coupon, so the amounts were not going to be the same. It can still be a duplicate charge even if the amounts are different, the charges were for the SAME ITEMS. I again explained to this Manager what happened and again he just couldn\\'t absorb the situation. He told me no adjustment would be made \"\" because there was no duplicate transaction \\'\\'. Today, XXXX/XXXX/19 I called Kohls back and requested, in writing, the resolution letter that was promised to me, within 60 days, on XXXX/XXXX/19. CSR Badge # XXXX again had absolutely no clue and again told me there was no \"\" duplicate charge \\'\\'. I then spoke to Manager Badge # XXXX and she told me the resolution letter had been sent to me already, I told her I did not receive it and asked to have a copy sent to me. She said she could not do that for me, that the letter came from the \"\" back office \\'\\' and she did not have access to it. I asked if she could contact them and get me a copy and I was told \"\" she had no extension to contact the back office \\'\\'. I asked if she could provide me with the contact information so I could call them and she said no, she had no contact number or information. I told her by law I needed to be sent that letter and she said that wasn\\'t true. I then hung up the phone. \\n\\nEven though I clearly explained what happened with the transactions on XX/XX/19 and provided the 2 different amounts I was charged and why, which should have been in my notes, not one CSR or Manager I spoke with could grasp this information, all they could say was \"\" THERE WAS NO DUPLICATE TRANSACTION \\'\\'. When I AGAIN explained the situation and gave the amounts, these sharp Kohls CSR and Mgr. could not grasp it. I have not been given the resolution letter, violating my rights and I have no way to obtain this or speak with somebody that has even a shred of common sense or able to perform their job. I demand, at the very least, that I receive that resolution letter and I would also request that somebody with some common sense and able to understand English review my account to see that indeed I was charged double for the same items.', 'This is a complaint for actions in violation of FTC Section 5, specifically as it related to unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce. \\'\\' It further violates The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act with \"\" abusive \\'\\' acts designed to takes unreasonable advantage of the consumers inability to protect his or her own interests when selecting or using a financial product or service. \\n\\nUS Bank closed my account ( ending in XXXX ) for their stated reason of believing that I fell victim to a credit card scam. After a phone call to them to inform them that that was assuredly not the case, they seemingly weren\\'t interested that I wasn\\'t actually the victim of a scam and kept the account closed. It is therefore my belief that US Bank closed my account for some other stated reason that had nothing to do with the safety of my account - the information they provided me was misleading. \\n\\nIn addition to the closing of the account in concern ( ending in XXXX ), they also closed my account ending in XXXX. \\n\\nWhile US Bank has the prerogative to close my account, in the process of closing the account, they refused to return the {$400.00} annual fee on account ending in XXXX ( which had been paid just 60 days previous ), the {$49.00} annual fee on the account ending in XXXX, and confiscated more than {$2000.00} in reward points across both accounts. They do not own the prerogative to confiscate money paid to them for services not rendered, nor do they own the prerogative to confiscate promised rewards which were obtained at cost to the consumer and which profited the bank. \\n\\nIt\\'s evident that US Bank baited me with a premium product and then inexplicably closed my account, taking my money and points without recourse or compensation. They were the beneficiaries of having an additional cardholder, receiving money in the form of an annual fee, credit card processing fees, and confiscation of rewards, while not providing any of the benefits promised to me. \\n\\nAt best this is a case of mistaken conclusions, handled poorly by a lending analyst.

The house was clearly advertised as heated, which was important since we were there in the middle of winter. Upon arriving however, we found that the only heat we available for sleeping at night were two small room heaters, one for each of the two bedrooms. Since the master bedroom was about 300 sq ft and overnight lows were 40 degrees Fahrenheit, the rooms were essentially unheated. We had a small child   with us, and after two nights of freezing cold we cut our visit short and went to a heated hotel room. \\n\\nWe first tried unsuccessfully to resolve the issue with our hosts, who at first said they would offer a credit, but then reneged. \\n\\nWe then unsuccessfully, to file a dispute with XXXX but they were unresponsive and put the onus on us to resolve it with the hosts. \\n\\nFinally, we filed for dispute resolution with our Citi AAdvantage MasterCard, which we had used to pay for the vacation. Our understanding of our agreement with Citi is that we are entitled to a refund if services or goods are defective or inadequate. We provided a detailed timeline of events, along with pictures of the listing, the room, the small space heaters, and the correspondence with XXXX. The total payment was for {$1400.00} -- we subtracted the first two nights we were in the flat, and requested a credit for was {$880.00} However, Citi refused our request on five different occasions. Finally they offered us a {$200.00} credit ( {$680.00} less than the amount we disputed and were out of pocket ) and closed the dispute against our wishes. ( At NO point would Citi dispute resolution personnel actually talk or email with us. Our only communication was a series of denial forms ) During more than two decades of using this Citi card, we have only disputed one other bill -- a railing installation at our house which was not completed for {$700.00}. We wish Citi would consider standing by its customers, and abiding by the agreements under which it issues cards to them.', 'I bought 2 round trip airline tickets from XXXX. They said they were charging me roughly {$2000.00} for the tickets.

I told them I do not want return tickets if I am not getting outbound tickets. They refused to cancel or refund my money. \\n\\nI called Chase Bank who I have my VISA card though. I told them I was ripped off and scammed. I said I was told I was buying round trip tickets and was only sold one way tickets. I said the company would not refund my money. They said they can not do anything because of the state the charge is in. I told them I am reporting a scam and being ripped off and expect them to look into it. I told them I do not care what state a transaction is in. I will not pay for one way return tickets.

In XXXX {$2500.00} in charges were made by me and since then Ive paid religiously {$100.00} or more. These security charges caused the card to reach a balance of almost {$3500.00}. Recently I called about the security charges in which I spoke with a delightful person who refunded {$1800.00} and some change to the account in question which left the account balance around $ 1500+. I recently channeled this same situation through this site in which I was contacted by a senior specialist XX/XX/XXXX through email and advised to call to speak about situation. I called and was greeted with a voicemail saying this person would be on vacation for XX/XX/XXXX, understandable. A week later with no call back I replied back to email on XX/XX/XXXX saying I received no call back about situation and received an email saying because of security purposes that this couldnt happen through the channels of communication I asked for.

A woman named XXXX left her number as XXXX ext XXXX. She left the case number XXXX in the message. I have called that number daily, still unable to speak with her. It rolls over to another customer service representative. Twice I was told they have my address incorrect and I informed them of my correct address.

On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX stated XXXX/capital one had my address as XXXX, Illinois-again incorrect. The {$130.00} was what I opened the store credit card with and the additional money is from late fees and charges for not paying the bill. They sent the credit card and all of the bills to an address similar to mine but in another city and then passed off this incorrect address to the debt recovery company. I have never received any mail from XXXX  capital one or XXXX XXXX XXXX. Over the course of this last year my credit score has dropped more than 100 points. XXXX  capital one again incorrectly updated my address as Illinois instead of Iowa. I asked them to send me anything just to prove that they had my correct address and show what exactly they wanted me to pay. I was informed by XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX capital one would not send me anything until I agreed to pay a settlement. I had to agree to a settlement that day and then something would be sent to me in the mail. I refused to pay {$390.00} as I am not responsible for their clerical error and continued incompetence. Damage has been done to my credit score and I was told capital one could do nothing to adjust that. I would be willing to pay more than the {$130.00} I owe if there would be some reassurance that my credit score would return to what it was before XXXX  capital one made this mistake.

Sometime back they changed this to allow for a single login for both accounts.\\n\\nWhile this may seem to be better for the customer, there is a significant problem with the web site setup that causes the customer to sometimes pay the wrong account and result in the customer paying additional late fees. When I open the website card # 1 is at the top and card # 2 at the bottom, however when I click on the bill pay button the order is reversed. As a result of reversing the order the customer may mistakenly pay the wrong card unless they carefully inspect the account numbers ( which is in small print ).\\n\\nI talked to a Bank of America agent who said SHE HAD MADE THE SAME MISTAKE and understood why it was confusing but nothing she could do about it. I find this reversing of the account order to be very deceptive and believe it is setup this way to trick the customer into paying the wrong bill for the purpose of collecting additional fees.', 'On the evening of XX/XX/2019, I was in my apartment when I received an email from Bank of America stating that suspicious activity was detected on my Visa card. It showed a declined transaction of {$650.00} at \"\" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX \\'\\' and an approved transaction at the same store for {$420.00}.

I told the service rep that I have never been to either of these establishments before. I also checked to make sure that the card was still in my possession -- it was -- and told the service representative. A fraud investigation was opened and the charges were removed from my account. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/2019 I received a voicemail from the fraud department asking me to call them back. I returned the call and was told my fraud claim had been denied because the chip had been used at the stores in question. I reiterated that I had possession of my card at the time of the charges, so this was impossible. They offered no proof that the chip had been used, but re-opened the case on appeal. They also put the charges back on my account. I received a letter soon after re-stating the reason that the claim was denied. \\n\\nAs a Bank of America customer of 12 years who has always paid my bills on time, I feel I am not receiving a swift or appropriate response to this fraud.

She advised me to wait few days and then to mail the package I have. I mailed my package later and received credit for it. However, I never received credit for the package that was received by the store and confirmed by the manager that it was received by their store. After multiple calls again, XXXX XXXX reps were confused and kept insisting they never received the package. I believe due to their confusing return and shipping process the package was either not entered in error or an employee stole it. During the calls complaining about the missing package the company managers were not even able to see my shipments came from multiple stores and that I mailed my packages rather than bringing them at a store ( not sure how the other employee saw the information earlier ). I filed a dispute with XXXX credit card only for my claim to be rejected because I \"\" already received credit \\'\\'. The issue is the 3 orders were processes as 10 separate charges all on the same day with no description or idea of which charge represents what ( items were randomly grouped and shipped from several stores and shipping centers ). When questioned XXXX XXXX  reps I was told they can not see my credit card. When I questioned my XXXX XXXX credit card rep about the charges they can not see which one is for what. It has been 3 months since this order and I am yet to get it resolved. It is important to note, this is not the first time the company \\'s actions has harmed me as a customer but this time I think it is important to report it so others are not having to deal with these issues while the company sits back and unlawfully collects revenue.', 'I have been a Citibank credit card customer ( almost exclusively ) for 28.5 years. I asked them to change my credit card from the XXXX XXXX Platinum card ( I\\'m no longer a fan of XXXX XXXX ) to a normal, cash-back card. However, they CLOSED my account of 28.5 years and opened a NEW account ( no credit history ) which immediately caused my credit score to drop from XXXX ( excellent ) down to XXXX ( 40 points ) while I am getting approved for a $ XXXX refi of mortgages. Because of the credit score change, this will translate to about $ XXXX/month in ADDITIONAL cost to me. I contacted them to explain the situation and re-open the account. They told me there was a process to re-open ( including a credit check ) and I told them NOT to check my credit again ( as it will drop further ) and they agreed not to. I was talking to \"\" XXXX \\'\\' a supervisor in Arizona. When we discussed the situation in detail, he actually explained to me that it was a BANKING mistake ( not a customer mistake ) and because of that, they WILL NOT check my credit. AGAIN, XXXX, A SUPERVISOR SAID THIS WAS A BANKING MISTAKE. NOT MINE. He said he will submit the request to re-open the account and I should hear in 24-48 hours. However, the next morning, I was notified that Citi DID check my credit!!! I have followed up by phone, chat an even in person at a Citi branch ( spoke to the Branch Manager for over an hour ... and she had customer service on the phone ) and all I have been told is to \"\" wait \\'\\' to see if they will re-open the account. No one can provide ANY answer or update. They just say I have to wait ( even though I was told 24-48 hours, weeks ago ). WEEKS later ( even though I have emailed and called almost daily ) I got a form letter that said they won\\'t re-open my account. No explanation. No discussion or human interaction. Just a form letter \"\" decline \\'\\' after 28.5 years and THEIR mistake. Now, I have to rebuild my credit ( and not be able to refi a $ XXXX mortgage because it now doesn\\'t make sense ) because of THEIR mistake.

It started last month at the same time on XX/XX/XXXX where I was notified that 5 charges were made in the amount of {$15.00} via XXXX. I contested charges last month and I was told by BOA Credit Card Services ( BOA CC ) that by closing my credit card ( CC ) account then the issue was resolved. They failed to tell me that they would still allow the carryover of charges ( even disputed ones ) to our new CC ( BOA failed to expedite the new CC despite our request and it took approximately one week to get a new CC ). We have numerous automatic charges so it took approximately 2 hours of my time to convert those charges to the new credit card received a week later ( New CC ). A month later the same 5 contested charges appeared on the New CC. We called XXXX  who agreed to block the charges and confirmed that these contested charges were automatically transferred by BOA. Each charge was for XXXX- apparently BOA had done NOTHING to block these charges in XX/XX/XXXX- instead they failed to tell us it was up to us to contact XXXX   to block and instead just transferred the charges despite this being the sole reason our CC was closed in XX/XX/XXXX. Because the New CC number was NOT compromised- there was no reason to do more than to dispute the charges. We contacted BOA as XXXX advised we had to do and explained the situation. As explicitly discussed during the call on XX/XX/2019, the instruction was not to cancel the new number as it had NOT been compromised. We were merely disputing the charges. However, we requested reimbursement of the approximately 80.00 in disputed charges. Our call was elevated to a supervisor named XXXX XXXX in the Rhode Island CC service center who was rude and abusive on the call resulting in escalated conversations. Throughout these conversations I was explicitly clear that I would NOT be closing the New CC and Ms. XXXX confirmed this fact including at the end of the call. Ms XXXX began to raise her voice as I repeatedly asked to ask a question but her demeanor changed rapidly and she because rude and condescending as she continued. Ultimately, I was able to tell her that I dont want to fight her but that we take care of this directly with XXXX and that if I had to then I would eat those monies myself so that this wouldnt be a fraud alert because after all, my new card was never compromised. I advised that I would contact XXXX and that if I had to then I would eat the monies myself so that my New CC remain intact- as the new card was never compromised. Regardless, I was shocked by her behavior and contacted BOA to lodge a complaint into Ms. XXXX temperament and rudeness. Hours later it is abundantly clear that Ms. XXXX went back into the account and closed it. This was clearly in retaliation for the complaint. Further, it appears that she failed to even dispute the charges at the center of this matter. This was clearly in retaliation for my complaint. Further, it appears that she failed to even dispute the charges at the center of this matter.The individual taking the complaint was a good kind agent named XXXX  who advised me that this was actually a billing dispute and not a fraud alert and that she would dispute the charges referenced above. After this was completed, XXXX filed my complaint against Ms. XXXX. Approx. 4 hours later I received a panic call from XXXX. Ms XXXX  had done the unthinkable. She cancelled my New CC despite 1 ). the card itself not being compromised and 2 ). my explicit instruction not to cancel it and affirmation of this instruction by Ms. XXXX. Obviously Ms. XXXX  went ( unauthorized by me ) BACK into my New CC account and cancelled the card. The timing is very suspicious as it occurred shortly after my report of horrific customer service. Further, BOA failed to timely notify us that it had cancelled our New CC- and sitting here today, I do not know : 1 ). why it was closed despite the facts above ; 2 ). effective date of closure ; 3 ). if BOA is honoring our dispute of the XXXX charges ( not apparent in the online information ).\\n\\nThis violates regulatory rules and ethics rules. We did not authorize the closing of the New CC nor did we authorize a disgruntled customer service supervisor the authority to go back into our credit card account and to take action.

Yes it would, but that never happened. By XX/XX/XXXX I had only received 2 Buyer names, one was 100 % Bogus, the other of which would never respond to any of my calls, texts, or emails. I requested a full refund from XXXX, also providing but they refused. They also said they have no control if the buyers are bogus or not but they still counted against my 15 to 20 per month. WHAT!!!! I filed a dispute on XX/XX/XXXX with Discover Card. On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from Discover Card stating they found in XXXX favor. This was unacceptable. On XX/XX/XXXX I emailed Discover Cards corporate headquarters. I submitted evidence of my claim, evidence of XXXX false advertising & bad review after bad review of other dissatisfied customers making the same claims. I was completely scammed & lied to by the salesperson & XXXX \\'s false advertising of their High Quality Buyers. I received emails nearly every day with their same claim of wake up every morning with Buyers & Sellers waiting for your call in my email box to work with. Again, this never happened. Discover Card had XXXX in corporate give me a call. He said hed look into it & get back with me in a few days. When he called again he said they still found in XXXX  favor stating XXXX has an A+ Rating with the XXXX, that I signed an agreement & they can not do anything to help me & their decision stands. I said XXXX is not an accredited XXXX  business & all the complaints are filed on XXXX XXXX XXXX, & the XXXX  rating was false & inaccurate. I had not received anything I was promised nor anything of value & asked how I was supposed to get my money back or anything of value for this purchase. He said I would have to speak to the Merchant, XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter in the mail from Discover Card dated XX/XX/XXXX stating they found in the merchants favor including a letter from XXXX  which stated their response on XX/XX/XXXX that I signed a 3 month agreement but that XXXX  makes NO GUARANTEES on their performance. Did Discover Card really look into this as XXXX said, because they made their final decision on the same date I sent the email, on XX/XX/XXXX. I went over & over this with XXXX on the phone but he said there was nothing he could do & kept telling me they had an A+ Rating on XXXX. Again I said XXXX is not an accredited XXXX  business & all the complaints are filed on XXXX XXXX XXXX, & the XXXX  rating was false & inaccurate. But my rebuttal fell on deaf ears. Discover Card left me no choice but to crawl back to XXXX. They said they would keep my account active until they provided 45 Buyers. Remember I was supposed to receive 15 to 20 High Quality Buyers per month, which would be 45 to 60 High Quality Buyers total in 3  months. A supposed buyers name trickled into my email box a few times a month. As of XX/XX/XXXX I had only received 27 supposed Buyer names, with at least 5 absolutely 100 % bogus, which still counted towards my numbers. How can XXXX  advertise & claim Go Ahead, Picture Yourself at the TOPQuality Leads, Quality Life on their website. Not one buyer name provided was a Quality Buyer. Only 2 even gave me the opportunity to speak to them & they werent interested. On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from the owner of XXXX he was closing effective immediately due to Covid19. I emailed Discover Cards corporate offices on XX/XX/XXXX with this information, reminding them of this crooked business, requesting this charge be reversed in full, requesting {$1700.00} be refund back to my card, stating The Fair Credit Billing Act passed in 1975 gives me the right to dispute a charge if Im dissatisfied & the merchant didnt provide satisfactory goods or service. I did so on XX/XX/XXXX. I also stated Discover Card did not do right by this Act in their decision & they did not protect me as a credit card customer. I stated this merchant baited consumers with false claims & false advertising & did not provide anything of value in return & did not provide satisfactory goods or service. XXXX was a total SCAM, RIP-OFF, A SHAM, APPALLING, UNSCRUPULOUS, MISLEADING, AND A FRAUD!!!!!! According to The Fair Credit Billing Act I demanded a full refund of {$1700.00} processed immediately back to my Discover Card account. Again corporate had XXXX call me appeasing me that hed look into it again. I received a call again today XX/XX/XXXX, their decision remains unchanged & they find in favor of XXXX. So the owner of XXXX walks away with my money without providing anything of value in return, without providing Quality Buyers in return & walks away with thousands, probably millions of dollars the rest of the public without providing Quality Buyers & Quality Sellers & without providing anything of value in return. Ive seen these kind before. XXXX had so many bad reviews hes closing up under the name XXXX & will reopen in a new business name with a clean slate.\"\\nWells Fargo contacted me about fraudulent charges on my card. They then cancelled my card and told me they would send a new one. They have not sent a new one and I can not access my account online. I waited for my card as instructed for approximately a month before they called and said I was late on my payment. I paid and complained that they had not sent a card and had not given me online access. They also filed a credit report and hurt my credit and charged a late fee. I paid the owed payments including the late fee even though I felt it was unfair. I have been unable to pay because they changed my account number and have not sent me any information on my amended account. It has been a month or so since and they have still not sent a card and have not given me any online access. They have stopped being helpful on the phone and they are now hurting my credit more.\\n\"I open a American Express XXXX credit card referred by my friend, and I was informed that I have XXXX bonus points ( roughly {$750.00} ) after spending {$3000.00} within three months. \\nI finish this welcome bonus task but never receive XXXX bonus points. I request an investigation for this issue inside American Express on XX/XX/2019. \\nI was never informed any feedback until I called them again. They told me the investigation was already finished and they found \"\" misuse incentive history \\'\\'. \\nThat means I had similar credit cards before or I closed cards right after receiving welcome bonus, which neither of them is true. \\nSo I asked for more details to prove this conclusion, but the representative said there is no detail or prove. \\nSo I believe american express has false advertising for a very long time or they secretly and intentionally stealing money from clients.', 'On XX/XX/2019 : I received correspondence that XXXX had ceased operations. They defaulted on providing a service in the form of a hotel reservation at XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX for {$260.00}. I called the hotel to confirm if a reservation under my name, XXXX XXXX, existed for XX/XX/XXXX, which they confirmed did not exist. Attempts to reach XXXX went unanswered. \\n\\nOver the next week, I sent a written correspondence to Barclays Customer Service to dispute and cancel the {$260.00} transaction at XXXX because the service provider defaulted on providing the hotel reservation service and ceased to exist. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/2019 : I followed up with Barclays Customer Service ( BCS ) on the correspondence and the status of the disputed charge. Barclays Customer Service referred me to the dispute department, which I immediately called. Barclays Dispute Department told me that the dispute had been declined, but that I had the option of paper mailing them additional details. I was dissatisfied with this because I had already mailed them the information with the email from XXXX. I contacted BCS again to no avail. Please see attached correspondences for additional details.\\n\\nBarclays Dispute Department substantiated that they could not go through with the dispute because the transaction involved a third party. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/2019 : I emailed XXXX XXXX, a Sr. Manager of customer experience ( information posted on XXXX  ) in a written letter expressing my dissatisfaction with the customer service experience and brought up Barclay \\'s Chargeback protection policy as a potentially valid means to resolve this dispute. Please see attached letter for additional details. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/2019 : I received a call from Barclays phone number XXXX from a person claiming to be a manager in the dispute department. I reiterated Barclay \\'s Chargeback protection policy in order to resolve the dispute, however the manager stated that the Chargeback protection was still not valid for this case. Shortly after, the call got dropped. \\n\\nAt this point, I firmly believe that Barclay \\'s Chargeback protection is valid for this transaction due to the following reasons : 1 ) The purchase was made using their credit card 2 ) The services were not provided by the vendor.\\n\\n3 ) I am within the 120 day time limit.\\n\\nI cite the Barclay \\'s website on Chargeback protection : https : //www.barclaycard.co.uk/XXXX And also cite the example of \"\" XXXX \\'\\' and how it relates to my case. I believe I have made every effort to act in good faith and be communicative in trying to resolve this dispute. Please see attached documents for all logged correspondences and details.\"\\nI was charged a late fee on my credit card for having been less than one day late. I paid my bill the morning following the midnight cut off period. Due to Bank of America \\'s computer system not working at the time, I was unable to make the payment on the Saturday XX/XX/XXXX deadline. Therefore, I had to make the payment the following day ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and thus I was charged a late fee of {$28.00}. I called the company ask that it be removed. They refused to do anything about the late fee. I spoke with XXXX XXXX in the XXXX call center on XX/XX/XXXX after I noticed there was a late charge. She refused to do anything about the fee and refused to waive it. I have been a loyal customer for Bank of American since XXXX. I am filing a complaint to have the {$28.00} late fee removed because there was an error in the online computer system of Bank of America that did not allow me to make the payment on the date/time that I attempted to. I would like the {$28.00} late fee waived or reversed.\\n\"Zales credit card just hit me with {$260.00} interest charge on my XX/XX/XXXX statement. \\n\\nI got a total of 3 different rings for them. The 1st time my husband order online in XX/XX/XXXXand when the ring came in it looked a lot smaller than it was online. So we returned it to our local Zales Outlet Store in XXXX, IL on XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nWe then purchased the 2nd ring on XX/XX/XXXX and when I was offered the promotion I declined it because I use to work for XXXX XXXX and they use to finance for XXXX XXXX once the 18-24 month of promotion would end they would get hit with anywhere from $ XXXX {$3000.00} worth of interest on their appliance so I rather pay the interest. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX we purchased the 3rd and final ring we bought. The young lady was suppose to do an exchange, however she stated that she had to do a return then buy the new ring. After she returned she was having some issues with getting me the new ring because Zales kept declining my card. Finally they stated they needed to speak with me when the young lady called the credit department. After doing some verification they finally let the sale go through. \\n\\nSo if I went from paying interest to a promotion I was unaware of it until yesterday. Well I get a notice from one of my credit monitoring on yesterday that stated that one of my cards are over the limits. It stated Zales. Please find the statements attached. It shows that I was paying interest on the 2nd purchase but changed on the 3rd purchase  unbeknownst to me.', 'I was warned by my card company ( by phone ) that two XX/XX/XXXX resort charges for {$1100.00} and {$600.00} looked like possible fraud. I informed the card representative that my daughter and I did not make these charges. He cancelled our cards. Later, I receivied a card bill for XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX that still had the two resort charges. I called a card representative and told him the two charges were on my bill. He cancelled our cards again. Next, I received a card bill for XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX that still had the resort charges and interest on those charges. I sent my letter of XX/XX/XXXX to the card company complaining and asking removal of the fraudulent charges and interest from my account. I then received the card bill for XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX with the fraudulent charges and more interest still on the bill. I sent my letter of XX/XX/XXXX complaining and requesting a reply by XX/XX/XXXX. I then received the card company XX/XX/XXXX letter stating : \"\" Per our records your account was issued a credit from the merchantin the amount of {$600.00}. Therefore, we have billed your account {$600.00}. This correction shows on your XX/XX/XXXX statement. We now consider this investigation complete. \\'\\' I then sent my letter of XX/XX/XXXX saying I had not received a credit of {$600.00} from the resort. The card company then replied by their letter strangely dated XX/XX/XXXX saying I was previously rebilled for the {$600.00} charge, and they had recredited my account for this amount. The adjustment would appear within one to two billing cycles.The card bill for XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX showed the {$600.00} credit, but it showed a balance that included the original fraudulent charges plus interest. ( I admit that I did not initially notice that the original fraudulent charges were still included in the balanced owed. ) I then sent my letter of XX/XX/XXXX saying that my card bill should only contain my current charges. I want my futures billings to only show what is owed from current charges and no interest. I always pay the full blance that I owe on my cards ( minus fraudulent charges ) so that I never incur any interest.', 'On XXXX i spoke with a total of 9 representatives from Discover on trying to seek an answer. The departments they were from was Account Managers and Account Opening Specialists continuing to bounce myself back and forth. I am trying to figure out if my husband and i are permanently blacklisted from ever having another Discover card again. \\n\\nMy husband and I both had Discover cards in XXXX which were closed back in XX/XX/XXXX if i recall correctly, by Discover.

Are we both blacklisted from Discover now because our accounts were closed by Discover? One rep suggested applying in 7 years since thats when bad remarks fall of credit reports. However our Discover accounts never went to collections, never missed payments, weren\\'t charged off. Just closed and either paid off or currently paying off. I called again and asked how long Discover keeps the \"\" Revoked/Closed \\'\\' Status in their system and was advised its permanent. Essentially my understanding is we will never be able to obtain a Discover card again if i am understanding correctly.', \"I notified Chase on XX/XX/XXXX that I wanted to block all charges from XXXX XXXX and I disputed a charge for {$490.00} due to false advertising, failure to deliver according to the terms of an agreement, misrepresentation of services. \\n\\nChase initiated the dispute and blocked XXXX from charging my account. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX charged my account {$500.00} and I disputed it with Chase. Chase informed me the credit card company would not intervene with any disputes with XXXX and validated all charges on my account including the {$500.00} charge. \\n\\nI notified the credit card company that I no longer agree to pay any charges to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and Chase still authorized and validated charges. The dispute customer service agent said that I should've changed my account number when I called in for the initial dispute because XXXX could change its address or name and rebill because the company has my card number. This was never advised during my initial call to dispute the {$490.00} charge. Chase sent me a copy of the XXXX agreement and stated it would not intervene with a service agreement which contradicts Chase 's financial services agreement with me. XXXX misrepresented itself and lied to me. I disputed the {$500.00} Further, Chase has communicated in an aggressive and unprofessional manner as if I am not its financial customer. It has stopped sending me statements, altered my online statements and email addresses ; has refused to send statements to me ( I was assessed a late fee but Chase never mailed me a statement ) because my attorney sent a demand letter. I paid everything but the XXXX charges which left a {$990.00} balance on my card. I do not use the card for anything but a monthly membership of {$24.00} and no my balance is over {$1500.00}. My online statements do not go beyond XX/XX/XXXX. I have paper statements in a file box which I will retrieve soon. \\n\\nChase needs to handle the dispute fairly. I have proof that XXXX lied and misrepresented the terms of our agreement. I have emails and screenshots that Chase refuses to acknowledge.

Got a letter on XX/XX/XXXX19 saying the balance transfer exceeded my credit limit. Credit union has no record of any balance transfer, but now this credit card company wants me to pay it, and the interest rate shoots from 0 % up to 24 % in two months! Got that letter XX/XX/XXXX19,  followed shortly by the two unsolicited credit cards.This puts my ( and my wife 's ) credit in jeopardy and is absolute fraud and theft! Shutting down all access to my accounts, big inconvenience and hours on the phone is what will become of all this. Called the XXXX XXXX number listed on the card, and some very rude customer service man there said I owe the {$2000.00} and that was that.

However, the company refused to address my complaint by stating \"\" During your online application you were advised based on your history with American Express Welcome offers, introductory APR offers, or the number of cards you have opened and closed, you are not eligible to receive this Welcome offer. The message also explained that no credit check had yet been performed and you were given the option to cancel the application or proceed. You elected to proceed with the application, without the Welcome offer. \\'\\' This claim was completely false. I am 100 % sure no such message was provided during my application, or I would not have proceeded with my application. In my initial complaint letter, I also clearly stated \"\" Then I was told that on the Amex website where one can apply for the credit cards there will be a message towards the end of the application process that tells you if you are eligible for the welcome offer prior to the final application processing. However, in my case no such message was provided during my application process. Hence, I assumed that I was eligible for the promotional offer. More importantly, Amex should be obligated to inform the applicant immediately even if they have the so called \"\" reserved rights \\'\\' to decline offer any time for any reason ( based on what the online agent said ). \\'\\' I suspect that the company was not even paying attention to my descriptions in the letter. This was a deceptive marketing event and though my conversations with other American Express customers, I learned that I was not the only one affected by the recent fraud activities. I demand that this event be thoroughly investigated and further involvement of legal authorities if necessary.', 'Citi Bank, per my citi MasterCard has liquidated my account, and online services and ability to pay by phone 24/7 ( through an automated system ) has be discontinued. NOTE the account was closed in XXXX during the financial crisis because the credit card wanted to increase my interest for no valid reason or gave me the option to close to prevent the increase. But now Citi has liquidated this account, when it is almost paid-off and payment options are so poor, it sets one up to miss making a payment. \\nThe service phone number on my statement takes me to agents who can not find my account or help me. I work during the day and the only time the phone line is available for service is during business hours and I struggle to call during breaks at work and this is not how customer service should occur.\"\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX a cashier \\'s check was mailed to the address listed on my statement representing payment in full of my Greensky Trade Credit account. I called and checked my online account in XX/XX/XXXX and early XX/XX/XXXX and was told by Greensky they didn\\'t have record of the payment and it should be reissued ( In the meantime I incurred additional finance charges and fees and had to make additional payments ). on XX/XX/XXXX an updated cashier \\'s check reflecting the current payoff was mailed to Greensky Trade Credit to the address listed on my statement. On XX/XX/XXXX the cashier \\'s checked mailed XX/XX/XXXX posted to my account, and because a new cashier \\'s check was issued as directed by Greensky, the XX/XX/XXXX cashier \\'s check had a stop pay on it and payment was reversed. On XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX I made additional monthly payments on the account and incurred additional finance charges. On XX/XX/XXXX I called Greensky and they requested a copy of the cashier \\'\\' s check which I faxed to accounts receivable department on XX/XX/XXXX. I called on XX/XX/XXXX and was told the payment had been sent to a different address for processing ( which was NOT the payment address listed on any of my statements ) and added my wife as an authorized user to this account. My wife called on XX/XX/XXXX and was told by a manager at Greensky that they received the fax and payment would post to my account within two business days. My wife waited until XX/XX/XXXX and called Greensky and was told they were still looking into it and would receive a call back from the manager she originally spoke with. On XX/XX/XXXX my wife called and was told she would receive a call back by Friday XX/XX/XXXX and the payment should post. She did not receive a call back and called again on Saturday XX/XX/XXXX and was on the phone for over 30 minutes and was told the manager is still looking into this matter and requests are handled on a first come first serve basis and could not provide a time frame for this to be resolved and payment mailed XX/XX/XXXX to be posted to our account. My wife was told payment was mailed to the incorrect address ( we pulled all statements which show the mailing address for the payment was correct ; however the XX/XX/XXXX statement o the last page, not the payment remittance page, shows the address will change for payments as of XX/XX/XXXX but we have been told payments were already being rerouted by Greensky. The next payment will be due on or before XX/XX/XXXX and we will continue to incur additional finance charges if payment does not post to our account which was mailed almost two months ago, and the payoff process began XX/XX/XXXX. Greensky is in the process of having a/r purchased by a different loan servicer ( we received a letter from a different lender indicating payment needed to be made referencing our account number ). I should not have to wait this length of time to have a payment that was properly mailed to be applied because of their internal issues.

They are lying stating that I never made a payment in XXXX and they are charging me {$85.00} in XXXX. I believe that he is XXXX. I only have {$35.00} to give Chase Bank this XXXX. I only have {$15.00} to spend every month on this card. Why would I owe so much? A XXXX female representative also called me a XXXX over the phone. They said they helped me however I am not certain. The minimum payment also increased to an amount {$50.00} for an unknown reason. I am XXXX.

I have always been an excellent Citibank customer since XXXX when I opened this account and I have always paid my account on time. When Citibank closed my account, it hurt my credit score because there is a significant balance on this account. I am very aware that as much as 30 % of my credit score is  based on the relationship between my credit card balance and my credit card limit. The action of Citibank closing this account caused me to be significantly over my credit limit, because there is no longer a credit limit reported on this closed account. \\n\\nThis is very upsetting to me because during this difficult time with Covid-19, I am trying to secure financing for my business and the action by Citibank in closing my account hurt my credit score and is hurting my ability to receive the financing that I need to sustain my business in this most difficult time. \\n\\nDuring my phone conversation with Citibank on XX/XX/XXXX, they informed me that the reason they closed my account was because they attempted to draft my checking account for the minimum payment due on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX but were unsuccessful. Once I learned of this error, I called Citibank and cleared up the problem. Again, I have never been late. \\n\\nI really don\\'t understand why Citibank would do this to me during such a difficult time as Covid-19 when I am trying to keep all my bills current and keep all of my employees on payroll.\"\\nOn XX/XX/18 I did a balance transfer with them and they did a double transfer on two of my credit cards that I wanted paid off. This has been over a month ago now and not resolved. I talked to a manager in late XXXX and she assured me it would be fixed in 2 weeks. Never happened. Talked to another manager in XXXX she assured me it would be fixed and she would call me back in 24-48 hours. Never happened and she never called back. Talked to another manager in XXXX and he said it takes 30 days to fix. Again, that never happened. Filed a XXXX complaint and was contacted by XXXX but I wasn\\'t available to talk to her so she left her name and number. I called her back yesterday and today and left messages to call back and that never happened. Meanwhile the credit card that I have with them is over the limit and I\\'m sure will be reported and my credit score will be destroyed. On top of that the minimum payment that I was supposed to pay is much more than I would have to pay because of this mistake. Needless to say this is all very frustrating and I need help quickly before my payment is due on the 16th if at all possible. Thank you.\\n\"Two purchases were made with my Bank of America debit card in XX/XX/XXXX totaling {$360.00}. The first, on XX/XX/XXXX, totaled {$160.00} and the second, on XX/XX/XXXX totaled {$200.00}. Both charges were to XXXX. I submitted a claim to Bank of America on XX/XX/XXXX and was initially credited the money back. However when the claim was resolved on XX/XX/XXXX Bank of America determined that I was at fault and took the money back out of my account. I suspect my information was skimmed online off of one of the sites I use for shopping, and Bank of America essentially said that because it did not occur at an ATM, they did not believe me ( and because the amount was not high enough ). They did no original research, including contacting XXXX. \\n\\nI called XXXX myself and was able to determine that the address both purchases were shipped to was the same P.O. box in XXXX, Florida, and the representative expressed shock that XXXX \\'s system would not have flagged the order due to the \"\" sketchy \\'\\' address. I have lived only in XXXX and XXXX XXXX within the last 10 years, and have not even visited Florida in many years. I was not able to get this information in writing, however, XXXX said they could release it if I came back with a subpoena. \\n\\nI submitted a dispute that same week in XX/XX/XXXX with Bank of America, outlining the new information I had received from XXXX. I was told I would receive an answer within 60 days. Well over 60 days later, on XX/XX/XXXX, I still had not heard any new information from the bank, so I called their fraud department to check in. The only information they were able to give me was that the claim had not been processed yet, but that they would put a note in my file and I could expect to hear again in 60 days. Needless to say, my confidence in their process is low. \\n\\n{$360.00} may not sound like a lot of money to some, however I am a full-time graduate student reliant on federal loans and low-paying part-time employment, and it would make a huge difference in my ability to pay rent this month.

When I closed the account they said that the remaining balance would be returned via a mailed check. The check wasn\\'t sent. I contacted them, and then they issued a check for the portion of the balance that was loaded to the card with cash but not for the {$2300.00} I had loaded via ACH transfers. When I contacted them again they said they could not return the funds without a letter of indemnity from the originating bank. I contacted the bank that the funds were originally sent from to request the letter. The bank then sent a confirmation letter for the transaction to Netspend. Netspend then returned {$2000.00} via ACH, but withheld the remaining {$300.00} and requested another letter. I then had my bank send the same type of letter on XX/XX/18 for the {$300.00} transaction, but did not hear back from Netspend. When I contacted Netspend again they said they required 20 business days to review the letter and that they would contact me once it was reviewed. I did not hear from them again, so called them again after a month, and they said the letter had been declined. I was forwarded to the fraud department. The representative said he would contact my bank and call me back within 3 business days. I did not receive a call. I called Netspend again and they advised me to wait a few more business days. Again, I did not receive a call. I called back again and was told to send another letter. I have called Netspend at least 20 times, with some calls lasting over 90 minutes and have been left without a way to recover my funds.\\n\"I signed up for an XXXX XXXX credit card on XX/XX/2019.

About a month later, I noticed that the {$250.00} credit did not apply ; I called customer service, and I was told to wait a little longer since it had not been long enough. I called again on XX/XX/XXXX to inquire about the {$250.00} credit.

It did not specify a difference between a \"\" fly now \\'\\' or a different program to receive that {$250.00} credit. Even the customer service rep I talked to agreed that it was malpractice and a misleading ad. She agreed to file a complaint for my case since that\\'s all she could do on her end.

USAA denies my dispute. \\n\\nUSAA is not able to help or answer the questions : How would I have canceled this service with a phone number that leads to a recording? \\nHow can I cancel the service now? \\nCan USAA confirm this account is canceled and no longer active? Obviously, I have no way to contact XXXX XXXX. \\n\\nbackstory : I had my office assistant order XXXX XXXX back in XX/XX/XXXX. We used the service only in early XXXX. I wasn\\'t aware it renews annually. \\nMy office assistant XXXX XXXX left the company in XX/XX/XXXX. Her email is no longer active. I don\\'t have the password to login XXXX XXXX. I was unaware the account auto-renews annually. I have no way to log in and use the account. I want to cancel it! \\n\\nI saw this annual renewal charge on my XXXX USAA statement XXXX. I called XXXX XXXX to cancel and get a refund. The XXXX XXXX phone number was a recording to go online. So I tried to go online at XXXX XXXX, but I could not log in, and there was no other way to communicate with XXXX XXXX online unless you login.\"\\nI applied for a XXXX credit card for BP gXXXX XXXX for my business, XXXX XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/2021. I received conditional approved status. I could pay a partial deposit of various amounts or I could personally guarantee the account. I chose to pay the partial deposit in the amount of {$200.00} on XX/XX/2021. After a few months I never heard anything back so I begin to contact the representative that helped me. I could not get in contact with her via email nor call. I emailed and calld over five times. So, in roughly XX/XX/2021 I contacted the general number and made a complaint and notified them I wanted my money back since I never received a card. The lady I spoke to said the representative I had been speaking with would get back in contact with me. I never received any communication back.\\n\"I opened a Bank of America rewards credit card in the fall of XXXX. The card had set percentages of rewards based on categories such as gasoline, stores, travel, etc. it promised an initial {$200.00} cash back if a certain amount was charged within a certain amount of time. I hit the required amount and had no issues getting the reward as a credit to my balance. \\n\\nIn XXXX of XXXX I received a letter from BoA stating beginning XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX I would be able to chose where I wanted the reward percentages to go, on a month to month basis. Since the current largest reward of 3 % was set to gasoline and I dont use much gasoline, I wanted it to go to the online shopping category. On XX/XX/XXXX I logged into my account, hunted all over where to change this category and couldnt find it, so I made a phone call. I was told that BoA had underestimated the amount of time to roll out this new program to all its customers and could not do everyone at once so I would have to wait. I was irked because my understanding of the letter about the program was that one could receive a maximum of {$2500.00} in rebates/rewards in a calendar quarter, and I had two large bills to pay with looming deadlines, so I missed out on getting those points. \\n\\nFinally in mid XXXX the program came to me and I changed my rewards to on line shopping since thats how I do most of my shopping. I had a couple of questions so I called BoA and talked with XXXX on or around XX/XX/XXXX and she informed me because I had a XXXX XXXX account with the minimum balance required, I could receive a bonus of 75 % extra points if I opened up a BoA checking account so I did. I know the extra rewards were confirmed because I got a welcome on my online account. \\n\\nSoon after that I called again because I wanted to make sure I understood something about how these 2 reward systems worked. We are going on a cruise next year and I have to make the final payment the middle of XXXX, one that is quite large, around {$15000.00}. The cruise line offers a 3 % discount for using an echeck vs. a credit card. I wanted to find out if I when the month came, switched my rewards to travel and used the credit card to pay for the cruise, would I get both the 3 % and the 75 % additional points on top of that, and I was told a resounding yes, that I could add around {$400.00} additional on top of what the 3 % would be from using the credit card. This was then a planned to do for me. \\n\\nThis week on Monday XX/XX/XXXX we decided to purchase our own airline tickets for the cruise, because the airline offered them cheaper than the cruise line. The cost was {$8600.00} ( business class ) but I called BoA first to make sure I could indeed switch my rewards category of 3 % to travel, and that this amount would qualify, and I was told yes. \\n\\nI switched the category, received an email confirming the switch and that it was effective the same day so I bought the tickets. \\n\\nThen going through my emails a couple of days later looking for ones to delete, I reread the one from BoA on XX/XX/XXXX before I made the airline purchase and thats when it seemed ambiguous about how the purchases worked with the rewards. I again called the company and asked if I would be getting XXXX points plus the extra 75 % points which would be XXXX. Total of XXXX points, or {$150.00} in rewards. After being switched to several different people and getting XXXX she told me the program only allows {$2500.00} in *purchases* per quarter, not {$2500.00} in *rewards* per quarter and I was way over that. I told her that was not how I understand it and was told by several people on several different calls that my understanding was indeed correct.', 'I just found out that Synchrony bank has been charging me {$10.00} a month on a card I\\'ve had with them since XXXX of 2015. \\n\\nFor the last six months I had been wondering why I couldn\\'t get my balance to go down. I thought maybe I had a subscription to something that I didn\\'t realize I had subscribed to, so I cancelled the card. I was still getting these fees and not understanding where it came from. I messaged someone on the live chat. They told me I signed up for it, what it was, and why it\\'s been there. I reacted in a very shocked manner because I really couldn\\'t believe eyes. \\n\\nKeep in mind I\\'m a XXXX year old attending XXXX  full time. \\n\\nI messaged XXXX on the secure messaging system, as well as the live chat, as well as emailing synchrony and XXXX.

I have talked to numerous people on the phone and gotten different answers from everyone. I have offered to settle my old debt, but my offer has been denied. I was offered another settlement amount ( which is more than I can afford ), and monthly payments. The people I have spoken to said that this will not help me with my credit and will not help with me with my goal of buying a house. I have paid off all old debts, except this account, and seem to be getting nowhere with the company. I think the worst part is that I can\\'t get them to send me anything in the mail saying what my options are for taking care of this old debt. The rep on the phone this morning ( in the recovery dept. ) said BoA doesn\\'t send out letters. How can I possibly resolve this old debt and rebuild my financial life when I\\'m getting so many different answers and can\\'t get anything in writing?\\n\"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, ME XXXX XX/XX/2019 American Express XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX, NY XXXX CC : Consumer Financial Protection Bureau XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Washington, DC XXXX Demand and notice of intent to arbitrate Promotional Amex Offer for credit card account XXXX To Whom It May Concern : 1.

On or about XX/XX/XXXX of this year, I opened two disputes for the other two amounts. The credit card company, Citi, provided a credit for one of the remaining disputes and mistakenly closed the other one, leaving a disputed amount of {$300.00}. I\\'ve called three times to try to get the last dispute handled properly. First, I was told it was too late, and nothing could be done, even though I provided everything requested on a timely basis. I called and another agent found a dispute specialist who told me to submit the documentation again, which I did that day, XX/XX/XXXX. I called two days later to ask if they had the information, and was told that they got my email, but rejected it because everything was not in PDF format - no one told me it needed to be. So, I converted the images to PDF and sent them again. That was on XX/XX/XXXX. I called today to ask if they have the information and was told no. Eventually, the specialist said that he saw my information uploaded to their system - five days later. I asked when I would see a conditional credit and was told I would have a decision about reopening the dispute within 10 business days - still no idea when I will get the credit. Taking five months to correct Citi \\'s error handling the dispute is completely unacceptable and is compounded by making me submit the same information repeatedly.\\n\"I am a business credit card account holder with Chase Credit Cards. There was an agreement with a company called XXXX in which they were supposed to furnish me with QUALIFIED leads for my business. We handled business over the phone. I made great emphasis in the fact that these leads needed to be approved by XXXX and my XXXX, they told me repeatedly that they were. One of the features of the service was that I would be able to use a very specific booklet along with the leads provided, along with the leads, they are suppose to provide all information needed so a consumer can make an educated transaction. \\nAfter taking this booklets and leads to my XXXX XXXX, I learned that not only these leads were not approved, the booklets were not XXXX approved. I immediately tried getting in touch with the company several times without much success. \\nXXXX finally got back to me on XX/XX/XXXX and they claimed that they can\\'t do anything to help me as they have no \"\" sway \\'\\' with my compliance department. Since then, they stopped responding despite several attempts to get in touch. \\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I made a call to Chase to report what had happened. They started the claim process and claimed that will get back to me once the issue is resolved. On or around XX/XX/XXXX I received a phone call from Chase claiming that XXXX had answered to the claim and that they have provided a signed contract which was odd because all communication with them was over the phone. They sent me the contract I supposedly signed via mail and after a brief inspection I found out the area were my signature goes was an odd looking scribble. I immediately went back to Chase and explained the situation and they asked me for my IDs along with other documentation that can show my signature ; which was sent to Chase on XX/XX/XXXX. \\nAfter phone confirmation of receipt of the email, I traveled over seas for less than 3 weeks. Upon my return, I followed up with Chase twice over the phone and they confirmed that the documentation was being reviewed and they will get back to me. \\nFinally, sometime on XXXX I notice that the temporary credit they placed on my account was gone. I called Chase to inquire about the result of the investigation and they claimed that the time frame in which I was allowed to make a claim had passed and they can\\'t do anything else for me.\"\\nMy company awards incentive trips and contest during the year, our expenses and incentives are paid to us by using a COMDATA payment solutions master card. I do not use the cards when i get them but do before the expiration date. I pulled a card out on XXXX to use becasue it was set to expire at the end of XXXX. I called to activate the card on XXXX and after I activated the card i was asked to hold, a person came on the line and told me that the card was listed as lost. I said that the card was not lost becasue I just activated it and have it in my hand. The recording on the line said that my card was now activated adn I needed to create a four diget pin and give the expiration date and the security code on teh back. I told the person that the card ending with # XXXX had been in my safe until XXXX so it had not been lost. I asked her if the money had been moved to another card becasue I have several and an additional card number with the last 4 numbers was showing below the one that was supposidly lost when I looked on line. The person would not answer this question and said that I would have to contact my State. I again asked her what happened to the money and the card was not lost and had not been activated until XXXX, the line went dead, she hung up on me. I called back and talked to another person, I explained the same thing and she finally asked if I wanted her to send a replacement card and I said yes. She asked for my address and I gave it to her, she said no your previous address, I told her that this was the only address that I have had for the past 20 years. I told her that my company provides this card and it might have their address on it, I was then asked when I got my last paycheck, I asked her what this had to do with the card but did tell her the date, she was again confused becasue none of this information had anything to do with the card or issue. The person then said that they would call me back after they looked into this, she never called back. On XXXX I called again and went through everything the third time. This person again said that the card was reported lost on XXXX, I again said that it was not lost and it was just activated on XXXX. The person then told me that the card had been used when I kept asking her what happened to the {$700.00} that was put on the card. I asked how was the card used when it was not activated until XXXX, and how was it used when it was reported lost, at this point the line went dead again. I have made three attempts and have been hung up on two times. I checked another card that I have that has an expiration date of XXXX and it also says that it is lost but I have it in the original envelope in my safe, it has not been activated. It appears that if a card is not activated and/or used within a year or so after it is issued it is going to a lost status so there is an issue or fraud at some point. I talked to two supervisors after I started this complaint and they were not much help either, the last one told me that there was nothing that they could do and they could not help me. Based on this experience I would never use comdata npayment solutions for anything. Thansk for your help.\\n\"I filed a CFPB XXXX : XXXX | Capital One XXXX : XXXX.

Wore it twice and washed it once after which it changed the dimensions and became loose. The only reason this would have happened would be due to the quality of fabric used for the production of the jeans. And this is why I reached out to the merchant. As mentioned in the documentation to bank of america, I opened a case with the merchant to take back the item, after which they only asked for photos of the product and few questions. After few days, without providing any justification, the merchant denied the claim with a pretty vague statement that I have already shared with bank of america. I then went ahead and filed a dispute via bank of america and provided all required information for the process of my claim. The bank took a long time to determine that they will deny the claim, once again providing no clarity with regards to the issue raised in the claim - \"\" We\\'re unable to dispute merchandise that has been altered. To dispute your inquiry further, the item ( s )  needed to be returned to the merchant in the same condition it was received. \\'\\' This doesn\\'t makes any sense as I have not altered the jeans in any way and as explained in my documentation to the bank, the merchant isn\\'t willing to take the item back. First of all, the merchant is bound to provide quality clothing. I did follow the wash instructions and was not at any fault. I filed the claim directly with the merchant within few days and within their 30 day return time frame. The very least that the merchant could have done is to take the item back, which they never agreed to, and should have investigated the claim using their quality control department. Denying the claim simply on the basis of photographs is absolutely not fair in my opinion. On top of that, the basis on which the bank decided to give the merchant benefit of doubt is beyond my understanding.

So it is entirely possible that someone ran the card through two card registers - one for a legitimate purchase and one for a fraudulent charge.\"\\nMy complaint is regarding a recent dispute with my XXXX credit card with Barclay \\'s bank account ending XXXX the case number they provided me is XXXX purchase dated XX/XX/XXXX merchant XXXX XXXX dispute amount {$190.00} my complaint first off is i ain\\'t Happy with how my dispute was handled the card company is going in the favor of the merchant because of them providing a tracking number that the item was recived how ever i never said the item was not received my disputed was for a different reason the item was damaged and was not new has described and i noted too the dispute represented on the phone that i did try too reach out too the seller and the seller was not responding back i understand the seller can contested this dispute how ever when this XXXX   tv was purchased from this seller on XXXX over the internet i never saw the merchandise intill it was delivered this seller has had many complaints from other customers of not receiveing merchandise or them sending items that are not working and not has described maybe XXXX or XXXX let fraudsters on there site but my credit card company is supposed to be there to protect my account information and when a purchase is made using my card online and if a seller is trying too committed possible fraud or not following through with services that are promise they need to take that serious the reason why i was not able too return item is the seller choosing too not respond too my messages and the thirty days too return the item of what was stated in there ad on XXXX  can\\'t be done now all returns have too go threw XXXX and with the merchant not working with me in the first place and XXXX won\\'t let the item be returned and me serious suspect potential fraud by the merchant and concerned whether my account information is truly protected against potential fraud when making purchases over the web or when a merchant on a site like XXXX or XXXX is there ripping people off i note this purchase was made on eBay but my credit card was process by XXXX but Barclay \\'s bank needs too handled this dispute seriously with it being made online and seriously listen too customers and this dispute needs too be resolved the right way\\n\"Over the last several months I went over the limit on my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX card by Citi.

This is not anywhere on the statement. They also bumped the interest to 29.99 %, almost double what it was because I was past due although they got the payment I believed was due on time. In XXXX I paid as much as the 2 payments from the month before on time and now they again say I am past due and want another {$200.00}. They agree that they got my payment on time but say it isnt enough? The statement says the minimum payment is the entire amount over my limit, but when they call, they have this other number they use. It appears they do this so they can keep me at the higher interest rate. What are my rights? Do they have to communicate these numbers to me? They allowed me to go over the limit for months, then decided they wanted it all. I am working on getting it paid off, they are only making it more difficult and in the process destroying my credit.

We tried contacting customer service a second time, they arranged a second delivery to replace the damaged items, they gave us more defective and damaged furniture for our living room and bedrooms. We tried to contact the managers to solve the problem, but its a corporate store with the same managers, for some reason they were not willing to work with us, we bought brand new furniture but they treated it like it was used by sending people over to fix it. Everything except the bedrooms was delivered damaged, we called the manager again 3 days after we received the stuff to return it, it states on the TOS that you can return items up to 7 days after the delivery, they ignored the request. After this we contacted the credit card company, which is affiliated with Ashleys and we attempted to dispute the charges.

The first statement was dated XX/XX/XXXX, and states \"\" XXXX XXXX XXXX \\'\\' meanwhile I actually bought the item in XXXX XXXX XXXX. I\\'ve never been to XXXX XXXX so I may even be due back money seeing as XXXX Lempira is equivalent to XXXX of US dollars. I\\'m not sure why this purchase actually shows as coming from XXXX XXXX.

( These charges are not accurate, and they were posted to my account after I paid off my balance in full ), Mysteriously they appeared thereafter the final payment was put through. I would like this to be looked into please seeing as I haven\\'t even received a bill for XXXX as of yet, and I additionally selected the option earlier today to pay this balance in full. Approximately 4hrs later I\\'m being informed of additional fees after attempting to close the account, meanwhile this afternoon the website showed a {$0.00} balance. This seems extremely unprofessional, and somehow fraudulent. \\n\\nPlease let me know if any additional information is needed from me, Thank you for your time looking into this discrepancy, XXXX XXXX XXXX\"\\nThe account has been settled since 2014 and is still affecting my credit report.\\n\"Ive been trying to resolve an issue with the annual fee on my credit card for 3 months now. Ive spoken to 4 different individuals starting in XXXX when I first received the letter making me aware of the fee. At that point I called looking for solutions on not paying an fee and was told to call back once it assessed and they would be happy to waive it. \\n\\nCalled in XXXX or XXXX to follow up on this and was told that the only way to avoid the fee was to close the card and apply for a new one. I simply dont want to pay an annual fee on a card where I have 2 others in my wallet that dont charge a fee and have comparable benefits. \\n\\nIve escalated through their channels to a manager where Ive been trying to come to a better solution set as paying the fee and / or closing the card simply isnt a feasible option with respect to the impact to my credit score. This has been my longest standing card and my highest limit. Closing this card would negatively impact my credit during a time of a housing search/home improvement financing discussions. \\n\\nMy last contact was to XXXX, a supervisor, on XX/XX/XXXX who called me back from a escalation I had previously on the same issue. Again, stating my agreement to the XXXX XXXX XXXX ( which I get and agree with ) he was unable to do anything. I asked to speak with him manager which he stated would call me back in 48-72 hours. I never received a call. That prompted my call today to resolve this issue to which I was met with the same discussion. \\n\\nAt this point, my complaint is no longer about the fee, its about the lack of reasonable solutions when I am looking to avoid a fee on a card where virtually annual fees are reduced across the board with different financial institutions. Being forced to pay the fee or negatively impact my credit isnt a spot where a consumer should find him/herself. \\n\\nAdditionally, an interest fee was assessed on the annual fee that was waived without me asking for or knowledge of. I didnt think one could charge interest on a fee?', 'I applied for a XXXX XXXX American Express Business Card on XX/XX/2018. Based on the promotional offer, I would receive XXXX XXXX XXXX  bonus points after {$3000.00} or more in eligible purchases are made on the Card within the first 3 months ( 92 days ) of Card Membership, and a {$100.00} statement credit after the first eligible purchase is made on the Card within the first 3 months ( 92 days ) of Card Membership. \\n\\nThe card was approved, and membership fee was charged shortly after. And I followed the spending requirement in the next 3 months but not bonus points and credit was issued. No communications at all were received from Amex to inform me that I was not eligible for the offer during that period. So I contacted Amex through online chat, and got the response that the sign up bonus on the card was declined on XX/XX/2018, the same day when my card was approved. I questioned if it was legitimate to decline the bonus without even notifying the customer, and instead wait until the customer to contact them to release such information. Then I was told that on the Amex website where one can apply for the credit cards there will be a message towards the end of the application process that tells you if you are eligible for the welcome offer prior to the final application processing. However, in my case no such message was provided during my application process. Hence, I assumed that I was eligible for the promotional offer. More importantly, Amex should be obligated to inform the applicant immediately even if they have the so called \"\" reserved rights \\'\\' to decline offer any time for any reason ( based on what the online agent said ). Otherwise, it is considered a deceptive marketing strategy to encourage the customers to pay the membership fees and meet the spending requirements without extending the promised benefits. In my case, I would not have applied the American Express Card if I was informed that I was not eligible for the promotional offer, or my bonus offer was declined on the same day I was applying for the card.\\n\\nI have my chat history with Amex online representatives on this matter and would be happy to provide them if needed.', 'XX/XX/2018 We were sent a statement on our credit account on a card issued by Chase bank. It was a XXXX XXXX card. We had not used the card in over a year and had received no statements in about 12 months. The statement received showed a balance of {$96.00} for an annual fee. Not having used the card we saw no sense in keeping it. I called Chase bank and asked them to close the account and cancel the cards, which I was told they would do. About a week later I received an acknowledgement that the account had been closed and there was still a {$96.00} balance. I wondered why I would be charged for and annual fee if I had not asked to renew in the first place. Plus I was receiving no service from Chase for that year though if they wanted a reasonable amount about for 2 or 3 weeks service, I would consider that. I day or 2 after that cancellation I received a statement showing a {$15.00} late fee on top of the {$96.00} fee that I thought in all fairness would be pro-rated. I called and spoke to someone in the credit department and asked that these fees and a reduction be considered. I received a letter from a \"\" senior service specialist \"\"  saying that the {$25.00} annual fee was assessed in XXXX of 2018 ( news to us as we received no correspondence ) and was considered valid. The annual fee was {$96.00} and the late fee was {$15.00} so I had no idea what {$25.00} annual fee that they they were talking about ... I had confirmed that Chase had no intention of acting in good faith so I sent them a letter denying their \"\" fees \\'\\' as invalid.. I told them that they should pay me that fee for the time and trouble that I had taken in attempting to deal fairly with this issue. I then told them that as we had not received any goods or services from them for the time that they wanted to charge us for, that we should just call it even and I would not respond to any further claims for payments that they had in no way a right to .. I get a statement every month showing more added late fees which also went to XXXX XXXX, who has been more than accomodating to Chase by zinging our credit scores each month. I will not tolerate Chase just charging me for something that I did not ask for or receive in full.. The {$25.00} \"\" annual fee \\'\\' mentioned by the senior service representative at Chase would have been fine with me just to get rid of them, but they wanted {$96.00} plus lates fees and it goes on and on. I have related these events as best as my recollection and paper records can substantiate. A review of any of our credit reports clearly show that we are NEVER late on any payments, NEVER have been. It\\'s only when we are grossly mistreated and cheated that we must defend ourselves and just say \"\" no \\'\\' to their claims ... Thanks for your patience and understanding..XXXX  & XXXX XXXX', 'I have a very high interest Capital One Card that also charges a membership fee. A few times I\\'ve tried to get the interest rate lowered and membership fee dropped ( my credit score is usually in the high 600 \\'s - 700 range ), but was was told I\\'d have to apply for another Capital One card to receive more favorable terms. \\n\\nSo, finally about a month or so back I decided to apply for another Capital One card that had 0 % XXXXnterest for a year and no membership fee, and I was approved. \\n\\nA bit after receiving the new card in the mail, I called Capital One to activate the card. At that time I told the Capital One Rep that I had gotten this card for the sole purpose of transferring the balance from the high interest Capital One Quicksilver card to the new 0 % interest Capital One Savor card. The Rep said she could take care of that, and would you like to do that today? I said no, that I had to get back to work, but I\\'d call back soon to take care of it. \\n\\nYesterday on XX/XX/2019, I called Capital One to do just that, but this Rep told me I couldn\\'t and that I was given the wrong information from the previous Rep. I said, something needed to be done since I was given false information. And to add insult to injury, I used the higher rate card on an expensive car repair and other purchases and would have used the Capital Savor Card with 0 % interest had I know this information. I was then told that nothing could be done, but that my interest rate on the Capital One Quicksilver card could be lowered from 21.5 % to 17.15 % LOL ( I just looked on the Capital One ap today and it\\'s still at 21.5 % btw ). \\n\\n1. The way that Capital One operates, by forcing a consumer to apply for an additional card to receive a lower interest rate and no membership fee is predatory and penalizes the borrower by lowering their credit score and forcing them to increase their amount of available credit. \\n\\n2. To make matters worse, the company does not honor promises made by their own employees, which takes their predatory nature to an even higher level.\"\\nBack in XXXX, I opted out of this company being allowed to charge more interest on already purchased items, therefore, the company closed my account and nothing has ever been charged on it since ... the interest was XXXX. Today, I receive my bill and they jacked it up, yet again, now its up to XXXX. This is unacceptable. I agreed to never charge again on this account and they agreed to never increase the interest rate. The XXXX lady was of no assistance. I want my over pay for the past couple of months credited back to my account and a FREEZE placed on this account like there should have been 10yrs. ago.\\n\"I contacted Barclays bank to request a closing my XXXX Account the week of XX/XX/XXXX and seek a refund of the {$95.00} annual fee that was collected from my bank 2-3 weeks ago. A phone rep took my information and asked me to supply proof of my identity to authenticate the request. I uploaded 3 documents in Barlcays \\'s website per the request including a copy of my driver license, copy of SSN card and a recent utility bill showing current billing address. About two weeks later, I checked the status of my account and my account was restricted with a fraud warning message to contact Barclays. I contacted Barclays the week of XX/XX/XXXX to inquire about the hold on my account. An agent told me they can not read any of my documents and request I mail in the same documents to their Fraud Department at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, DE XXXX. I mailed the requested info late XX/XX/XXXX and contacted the Barclays a third time on the week of XX/XX/XXXX to inquire about the account closure request and refund status. A third agent explained they were not able to read my driver license and need to mail that in again. I mailed a second photocopy of my driver license to Barclays in early XX/XX/XXXX. My account remained restricted and not close. I contacted the Bayclays a fourth time on XX/XX/XXXX. The agent explained he was able to read my driver license but when it was scan to the computer, the computer could not read it and therefore I need to submit a clearer picture of my driver license before he can review my account and close it. I scanned my driver license again using the best possible setting possible and print the image in the highest quality. I could read all the data on my driver license fine and the 4th agent I spoke with agreed with me. I mailed it out to Barclays on XX/XX/XXXX with no guaranty the documentation is acceptable to Barclays or its computer systems. I just want to close my credit card account at Barclays and get the {$95.00} fee back as I am not using the card. I don\\'t know what else I need to do to satisfy Barclay \\'s requirement to close my account and need help. Another annual fee could hit soon and the longer I wait for this to get resolved, Barclays may only provide a partial refund of the annual fee versus a full refund if it was processed correctly in XX/XX/XXXX.\\n\\nAccount is restricted and correspondence via secured email with Barclays can not be downloaded. 1 paper mail was received during this 5 month ordeal. All other communications were via phone call by cardholder to Barclays never the other way around.\"\\nI have disputed the amount of {$830.00} ( Account # XXXX ) with Home Depot Credit Services XXXX to improper installation of a XXXX XXXX. While the XXXX XXXX was delivered it was improperly installed. I have paid for the washing machine was to be installed and ready to be used. That did not happen!!! The installer forgot to remove the shipping bolts from the back of the washing machine. As such, when the machine was used the shipping bolts prevented the washing machine from spinning thereby causing the washing machine to vibrate very badly and move uncontrollably through the laundry room causing damage to the walls and the furnace located in close proximity. The failure of the installer to remove the shipping bolts caused damage to the drum and internal parts and has negated the warranty for the product. The Home Depot Credit Services denied my complaint by letter dated XX/XX/2022 saying that their research revealed that the washing machine was delivered. Furthermore on on XX/XX/2022 the Home Depot Credit Services noted that they will provide special financing per my request. I did not request special financing but to receive the services that I have paid for. I received a faulty installation and a damaged washing machine. XXXX XXXX will need to replace both in order for payment to be made.\\n\"XXXX XX/XX/XXXX I hold a Government Travel Card. I filed a voucher and had a credit of over $ XXXX to transfer to my account. Citi has a policy of not allowing a balance transfer for 10 days on their website. When I used a chatbot/customer service, every attempt at obfuscation, delay, etc, was thrown at me to prevent transferring the balance sooner. When I asked for an exception to policy, the chatbot or person used weasely phraseology, \"\" Unfortunately, I am unable to make an exception. I apologize, \\'\\' which while true as she\\'s or it is not empowered to do so, I had to elevate and ask who would. After that, I was sent paperwork to fill out. I was informed that it would take 2-3 business days to complete. I asked if there were any legal or technical reasons for the delay or if it was company policy, I was told it was policy and that an exception to that could not be made. I replied that they\\'ve transferred to my bank before, that there is nothing to verify that would take 2-3 business days. \\n\\nWhile possibly not illegal, I feel it is highly unethical. I detest being compelled by the government to use a card I didn\\'t ask for and for which the government receives a kickback.\"\\nI have been a Capital One XXXX customer for years. I contacted Capital One to inquire about possibly upgrading my card to one with no annual fee and was told that was not possible. I then requested that the annual fee be waived this year possible and the customer service rep advised that He would be unable to waive the fee at the time we spoke because it was early and the fee had not yet been assessed. He suggested that I call back and request a waiver of the fee once assessed. I called back and was told that my account did not qualify for a waiver based on the systems algorithm?? when she tried to submit the request. I asked what the algorithm was based upon, I cant recall ever being late etc ... and she was unable to answer. In the interim and I received a preapproval offer from Capital One for a XXXX XXXX Card. I was considering booking a vacation, so I went online to see what perks they were offering with the card as well as the terms and conditions rates etc.. Online the XXXX XXXX offered showed a promotion that stated that if you spent {$1000.00} in the first 3 months you would receive {$20000.00} bonus points. I attempted to apply for the card online, but since I was logged into my account. The system kept diverting me to enter the confirmation number for the preapproved offer Id received. Not stiputlating that the terms would be any different. It would not allow me to just apply for the card otherwise. Needless to say, I booked my vacation, the charged went through. I called later to inquire as to when I should expect the points to be posted and was told that my account did not qualify for the promotion. I went online while the rep was on the phone and confirmed the details. She then stated that the promotion was not included my MY specific offer! What?? I would not have accepted the offer had I known that this was the case. I have plenty other cards that I could have used and received some benefit for my purchase.the young lady agreed that I met the conditions and state that she would escalate my concerns and follow. A few weeks later she called back and stated that her request was declined and that points would not be applied. I was so frustrated at this point, I just hung up, figured Id pay the card off and both or transfer balances or whatever. Coincidentally, I then receive a call from their Executive Customer Relations department, inquiring about my complaint.I explained my concerns to the young lady, who stated that she would research and follow up, I do not remember her name, but Im sure the call was recorded, that was before XXXX, I believe and to date I have not received a follow up call. This is like bait and switch. Their system would not allow me to apply online unless I used their confirmation code. The current promotions were advertised online, the only difference was the promotion but how is a consumer to know that. It never stipulates that this does not apply if you use a preapproved offer. And that itself is backward, wouldnt you want to give a preapproved customer a better offer? This is clear deception of a loyal customer\\n\"On XX/XX/XXXX, I had a last minute cancelation at a XXXX XXXX and was charged a fee on XX/XX/XXXX ( {$200.00} ) I opened up a dispute with Amex to remove it, and during this dispute XXXX reversed the fee. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX refunded me. On XX/XX/XXXX, Amex gave me a {$200.00} credit pending decision of dispute. \\n\\nI told Amex that XXXX had refunded me so they could close the dispute. Amex then reversed their initial credit of {$200.00}. ( XX/XX/XXXX ) Things are now settled. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, Amex issued me a correction charge for the misposted credit for {$200.00}. This is where that took money from me. \\n\\nI opened up a dispute shortly after regarding this mis-adjustment. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, they finally gave me credit for their mistake of {$200.00}. ( At this point, things are settled ). \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, they issued me another correction of {$200.00}. The issue is still not resolved after multiple attempts.', \"I accepted a promotional offer by Citi Credit Cards to do a balance transfer for car loan at XXXX XXXX. I used a check sent by Citi with which I was supposed to pay the remaining balance on the loan, which was {$2300.00}. After submitting the pay-off check to XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX, I later received a letter from XXXX XXXX informing me the check was returned to sender. This is reflected on a XXXX XXXX account statement indicating the payoff was reversed on XXXX XXXX. \\n\\nI therefore called Citi to inquire about the reversal. They informed they did not know why it did not go through and then recommended I send a second payment, so I authorized a second payment of {$2300.00}, the increase in amount accounting for interest accrued since the reversed payment. The second payment went through to XXXX XXXX, which was reflected on my XXXX XXXX account statement. However, my Citi account showed that both payments went through, both the {$2300.00} AND the {$2300.00}. \\n\\nI called Citi to ask about it, and they told me they would start an investigation into the payments and told me to tell XXXX XXXX that Citi would be calling. I then called XXXX XXXX to inform them of this. \\n\\nSeveral days later, I called Citi to ask about the status of the investigation. They did not know the status and could not tell me. They said they tried to get me in touch with an account specialist but could not get ahold of one and recommended I call back later. \\n\\nA week later, I called Citi again to ask about the status and hopefully get in touch with an account specialist. I was then bounced around to several departments, each one saying that they would transfer me to the correct person, none of whom actually helped me. Finally they directed me to a person purporting to be able to help, but she began asking the same questions that were asked when I first filed the dispute and told me to inform XXXX XXXX they would be calling. This didn't make sense as an investigation was already allegedly underway. I asked to speak to a manager and was put on hold indefinitely. I had already been on the phone for 41 minutes, so I did not want to wait any longer.\", 'XX/XX/XXXX I was on the XXXX XXXX web page and I was looking for a credit card that would not charge a fee to do a balance transfer. I put on the application that I would want {$8000.00} but I did not complete the application when I read the terms of agreement and saw that they charged a 5 % fee on balance transfers. I simply closed the web page not authorizing or requesting or agree to an account with XXXX XXXX. Barclays took it upon themselves to send XXXX XXXX XXXX {$8000.00}. I did not identify that I wanted the money to go to XXXX. XXXX acceptable the money from Barclays even though my XXXX account was balance-free and closed. XXXX then took XXXX of the XXXX and sent me a check for the balance. I never received the check. Barclays begins to email me and telephone stating I owe XXXX to them for the unapproved balance transfer. When I first spoke to a Barclays representative I asked, do I need to get the money from XXXX? I was told no, that this would be seen or processed as a fraudulent claim and therefore I was in no way responsible. I then received a letter from Barclays stating that I was in fact responsible and that I had gotten deep enough into the application whereby I was procuring their services and so I did request the money. I never received a credit card from XXXX XXXX, I never activated a credit card and I do not know this account \\'s number. Next I spoke to several representatives on Friday, XX/XX/XXXX where time and again they would say to me, we aren\\'t going to go round and round with you, you have the money, pay it back. Not once did anyone listen to me that I didn\\'t have the money, that perhaps they should be contacting XXXX to see if they had the money and that I simply could not understand how I was responsible for this faulty and misleading transaction. I was treated like a liar and a criminal when in fact I believe that it was Barclays who was subjecting me to unfair business practices and dishonest and unreasonable expectations. The matter was resolved on the phone when XXXX, a Barclays rep and XXXX, a XXXX XXXX XXXX agreed on a 3-way call that XXXX would send Barclays a check in the amount of XXXX and stop payment on the check that was sent to me by XXXX for XXXX minus the XXXX fee that they kept. All of this simply did not need to occur if the first representative I spoke with at XXXX XXXX had listened to me when I stated that I had not completed the application and my husband and I had gone to our credit union, secured a personal loan that included paying off the XXXX XXXX balance and subsequently closing that account so that I didn\\'t feel I have any responsibility for retrieving their misplaced balance transfer.

During the period of XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX, we received ZERO communication from Citi. From XX/XX/XXXX to now, we have made numerous phone calls to Citi and received ZERO promised return phone calls. This is in direct contradiction of the statement in XXXX XXXX letter : \"\" Should the merchant provide documentation to support their claim, we will contact you at that time to discuss the details of their response. \\'\\' As we are the direct witness of the Merchant misrepresentation, any falsified documents or statements from the Merchant in this dispute can be easily uncovered by us. All it needs to take place is for the Citi investigator to communicate with us during the dispute, just as XXXX XXXX stated. The promise from Citi executive team is nice, but it seems that it doesn\\'t translate into actions for its investigators. \\n\\nBased on our experience, Citibank has many good people working hard to do the right things for its cardholders. But its investigation team appears to have the culture of ignoring or presuming guilty on claimants.

The fraud continued to happened and led to over {$10000.00} ( and possibly up to {$50000.00} ) worth of fraud charges that I am still attempting to be reimbursed for from Discover. These were some of the first charges and if Discover would have taken action, a lot more could have been prevented. \\n\\nI have provided police reports, FTC identity theft reports, credit reporting reports, and my own personal expenses to hire experts to prove that my identity was stolen and fraud happened on my card.

Normally, we would have been able to assist you with refunding the unauthorized purchases, however, in this case, the transactions were also used in the game which will not allow us to retrieve the purchased goods and trigger the refund mechanism. We strongly urge you to set up parental control on your devices as it is out of our control if someone underage is accessing your account. As per our Terms of Service, no minor should be accessing the game, however, we can not monitor or prevent minors from accessing accounts owned by adults. It will help you tremendously to avoid this kind of situation in the future if you set up your devices in a way that will prevent your child from accessing the game and purchase. As a less effective method, you can also remove the card details from your accounts so the purchases won\\'t go through even if there is an attempt at purchasing by someone other than you.

I had in the past switched credit cards several times under Citibank, transferring the rewards points each time with no special action needed. When I converted from a Thankyou Rewards card to a cashback card, in the detailed terms and conditions, which were not prominent, there was a notice that any rewards points would have to be used within 60 days which I didn't see. With the new cashback card I received many emails from Citibank, none of which mentioned that my rewards were going to expire. When I noticed that my rewards points had disappeared, about a week after the deadline, I called and started a support case to get them restored. I never received any response, and several times was told to call back in a few days for it to be resolved. On XXXX I had a conversation with a manager that said the points could not be restored. I believe Citibank 's policy was purposely deceitful, with no notice, reminder, or warning that I would loose {$1700.00} dollars because I didn't read the fine print on their offer. The new cash back card also provides Thank You Rewards points, so it is not even a case of the new card not having that feature. \\n\\nI can provide copies of all the emails sent to me by Citibank after I converted the card, and none provided any warning or mention that the rewards points would expire.

Either it\\'s 18 equal monthly payments or billed in full but it can\\'t be both. This practice is deceptive and misleading at best and both Amazon and Chase have been irresponsible in resolving this. \\n\\nThis entire experience has been one of unending frustration with both Amazon and Chase so I am requesting your assistance in getting a resolution and the payment plan I was promised.

No mention of my refund. \\n\\nI called back on XX/XX/2019 to see if it would be possible to have the refund that I never received applied to a new secured card. They let me know that this was not possible because I would have to reapply for a new credit card. However, my refund should be issued and received within 7-10 days. As of today XX/XX/2019, I have still not received my refund. I opened the app and found that a stop payment had been issued on XX/XX/2019 and a check had been re requested XX/XX/2019. Tomorrow, XX/XX/2019 would put me outside of the 7-10 day window for the refund I requested on XX/XX/2019. After spending an hour on the phone with management and other nonchalant representatives, I am concerned about the legitimacy of this company and the refund I should be receiving. Just as I would be responsible for interest after a 3 month delay in payment, I feel that I should be compensated for the delay and inconvenience.

When I returned in XX/XX//2018 from my trip, I contacted Capital one to dispute the charge, I sent a 2 page letter and pictures showing proof of my dispute. I called weekly and spoke to customer service, managers and finally I wrote to the CEOs of Capital one to get help. According to capital one, I had a valid dispute but they refused to reverse the charges because they wanted another travel agent to collaborate the claims. When I told them that I did due diligence to obtain a report from another travel agent but no one wanted to write a statement nor have they ever heard of such request. I became discouraged when I realized that Capital one did not want to help resolve this dispute and hid behind a wall of deception. I continued to make payment on the card but knew that what they said was false. They do not help with disputing charges and they take the merchant 's side in disputes. \\n\\n\\nPlease see the letter enclosed to Capital one in XX/XX/2018.\", 'A charge of {$280.00} from \"\" XXXX \\'\\' was received on my Bank of America card on XX/XX/19.

I did have an account with XXXX which had been closed due to an expired credit card on file. I did not want to renew this account so prior to the expiration, I confirmed with a rep through the XXXX online chat feature that the account would just expire. To be sure, she told me she had unchecked the \\'auto renew \\' option on my account and I had nothing further to do. \\nI sent hard copies of the emails from XXXX and a letter detailing the timeline to Bank of America on XX/XX/19 to the address in the letter they sent to me which had denied my initial claim ( they do not accept emailed copies ). I received confirmation on XX/XX/19 that they had reopened my claim and I would receive a response within 30 days. XX/XX/19 - No response from Bank of America, I now have a bill for {$280.00} due on XX/XX/19, they state they have not received my documentation, the XX/XX/19 claim needed to be reopened ( even though I never received any notice that it was closed ) and I am responsible for making payments until they resolve the issue.

I then asked chase to issue me a check for the money and then closed my account. I was very happy.

I am very upset with this situation and I feel as though I am being taken advantage of once again.

This charge is one of the few others that were being charged by the same merchant and was disputed successfully except for this one. \\nAgain, CITIBANK and/or XXXX failed to provide proof of authorization of this charge of {$100.00} nor to show what was the charge for.

Furthermore, base on Visa Credit Card company, credit card with a chip built-in & \"\" chip scan ready \"\" terminal at the merchant could waive a signature, ONLY APPLICABLE IN THE USA. \\nCITIBank is not protecting the interest of its members and appears to be negligence in their investigation of possible misuse/fraud of my credit card info.by the merchant.

Then the company notified me I was past due by 30 days - throughout that 30 days, I wasn\\'t notified.

Then the rep proceeded to tell me my statement had already been cut and it was mailed out on XX/XX/XXXX. She also told me my due date was XX/XX/XXXX. After still not receiving a credit card or a statement I called Capital One on XX/XX/XXXX. The rep told me that she doesnt know why I was previously told it takes 30 days to get a card. She said that is not true, she said it takes 7-10 days. She then said the address for me in their system was incorrect. She updated my address to the correct address and she said she re-issued my statement and also re-issued me my credit card. I did receive my statement but I STILL HAVE NOT received my card. I called Capital One again on XX/XX/XXXX demanding to have my card overnighted to me. Before that I was told cards take 46 days to arrive. I demanded to speak to a supervisor. Supervisor verified my address and could not tell me why I dont have my card. She said she could reissue another card and send it 2-3 day priority mail. I then paid my bill over the phone with her. On Wednesday XX/XX/XXXX I called Capital One again and I was told they dont have the capability of sending cards out 2-3 day mail. She said they only send standard mail 4-7 days.

I also pay the full amount, this month it was {$5500.00}, a few days before the due date. \\nThe representative insisted that does not qualify as being paid on time. They have it rigged so It\\'s impossible to pay on time according to them. I think any reasonable person would say that I\\'m paying them on time and have never been delinquent. This has been going on for many months. And I have paid thousands of dollars in late fees even though I always pay on time in full. \\nThe best arrangement I could get with them was to pay my bill in full automatically for 2 months and then I might not be charged any late fees after that. \\nOut of desperation and because they left me no alternative, I agreed to that arrangement. \\nI think what they are doing is unethical and probably illegal and that they should refund all my late fees to me.', 'My wife and I opened an account through TD Bank, NA XXXX Renovate in late XXXX.

The representative agreed to reverse the late fee \"\" as a one time courtesy \\'\\' ( their words ) even though, as I pointed out to them, I had not made a late payment and was actually a month ahead on my payments. \\n\\nI believe this company is engaging in predatory practices. They are punishing me for attempting to pay off my balance ahead of time and for trying to keep ahead of due dates by paying early. Also, as part of the agreement, it is a requirement I pay the balance by a certain date and with no late payments in order to avoid accumulated deferred interest. I believe TD Bank, NA is trying to use this practice to say I made a late payment so they can then assess all of the deferred interest charges against me and raise my rate from 0 % to the extremely high interest rate the card normally carries.\\n\\nI have had countless other loans in the past thirty years and have used this same method to pay them off early and to avoid missing or being late on payments ; no other company has EVER told me I couldn\\'t make early or extra payments and they certainly have not tried to assess fees on me for doing so.', 'I have been a devoted customer of NetSpend Corp card services since 2006.

They will not stop the payments from posting even though I have informed them they are fraudulent. This pre-paid card we are forced to use for unemployment is supposedly backed by Master Card ... what good is that is they do not employ the same security and fraud assistance as Master Card? I didnt ask to be laid off and I certainly did not ask for a prepaid card for my unemployment but we arent given a choice. It makes no sense why they would wait for my money to be stolen before taking any action. Any other legitimate card prefers to stop the fraud before damage is done.

I reported the theft both on-line and with a phone call within an hour after the theft.  At the time of my report, cash had been removed and fraudulent charges made.  After numerous calls to the credit card company I was told I was not liable for those charges made on XX/XX/XXXX.However, on XX/XX/2019 I received a letter saying I needed to pay the $XXXX of fraudulent charges, along with transaction fees and interest.

I have 4 cards and they were all behind on payments which the agent and I discussed prior to making the payment. The agent assured me that I would be able to use the card on my vacation after the payment cleared from my bank in about 2 days. I was not able to use the card and I called Amex to see why, the agent said that she needed to call my bank and confirm the payment was taken out, we did a 3 way call and verified that in was taken and applied to my account. She then tried to release the hold and restore my charging ability but she could not. She elevated it to a supervisor and that I should call back. When I called back they said that they would not be able to restore my charging, because the other accounts were in default and offered me a full refund of the payment since the payment was made under false pretense. They reviewed the recorded conversation with myself and the agent and agreed that he was not truth-full when I made the payment and assured me that the refund was issued. When the refund did not arrive in the mail within 10 business days I called back and they assured me that refund would be deposited directly to my bank account and apologized for the delay. I gave them my account information and it was supposed to arrive in 3 - 5 business days. When it did not arrive again I called and another supervisor assured me that it would be refunded by mail and that I would get it in 7 - 10 business days. 3rd attempt dated XX/XX/XXXX, ref # XXXX. As of this date American Express has not issued my refund as promised. They have not restored my charging privileges and have been dishonest in their business practices on several occasions.

They reported me to the Credit Bureau what affected my score considerably. \\nI called customer service because even when I\\'m not enrolled on paperless statements, I never received an Statement over the mail. I was wondering I had the autopayment choice saved with them. Online they have a tab with Alerts and Messages. Both inbox are empty. I never received an email or notification about these late payments. Usually banks call their customers when this happens. I never received a courtesy call from them. I asked why I never received any notification and the responses were ridiculous. I was reading the reviews of this bank online and they use to abuse with customers and this case is similar to many others. \\nI really would like this bank to stop abusing customers, this is not the way Bank acts.\"\\nFidelity Rewards Visa failed to protect me against a predatory and unethical merchant charging me for services not rendered, improper billing, damage to my property, and misrepresentation. Fidelity Rewards Visa is the branded credit card of Fidelity Investments and is operated by Elan Financial Services. Detailed complaints were sent certified mail to the credit card company on XX/XX/2019 and XX/XX/2019. The complaint was handled by a staff member who was not qualified to handle the complaint, never returned my phone calls, and accepted the merchants position despite thorough documentation supporting my dispute. The letters sent to me by Fidelity Rewards Visa failed to describe the resolution or the facts supporting the resolution. The result was a loss to me of {$1400.00} to a merchant who continues to prey on the public and stands to lose their license to operate as a result of their unethical behavior. Despite numerous phone calls to the credit card company to escalate the dispute to a supervisor, the supervisor has never made a serious attempt to contact me. Representatives of the credit card company make cursory calls but never leave a message so that they can document their internal files that an attempt was made to contact me. The failure of Fidelity Rewards Visa to protect its consumers is systemic and needs to be investigated.\\nThis is my third CFPB complaint, Capital One is not even replying or answering my complaint at all. I have been on the phone with Capital One to request my credit balance refund check of the balance on the account of - {$8600.00} XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX.\\nI made a purchase at Kohl \\'s Store the Order Date : Monday, XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX ( CST ), this purchase never came to the house even though the tracking number indicated that it had been delivered in the home. I called the USPS that was where they received the package through UPS, and they did an investigation and said the package was delivered at the wrong address or was lost. Then I made the claim to the Kohl \\'s store and they started an investigation and determined that the package was lost and that they were going to replenish the money to the credit card of the Kohl \\'s store, but from the date they keep charging me and sending invoices with delay fee that are increasing and that are damaging my credit. The strangest thing is that in more than 7 claims that I have made, in the last claim I made they told me the order was received back to one of their stores several months ago and today XXXX, XXXX XXXX, even they still charge me the bill and damaging my credit and not result.\\nOn XX/XX/2019 an overpayment was made to my XXXX XXXX  credit card. They will not give me my money back which is {$1900.00}. I have multiple voice recordings of their customer service telling me the check is in the mail. I am headed to court to start a suit against XXXX XXXX. Regulation Z states any overpayment money is to be returned to the credit card owner. Ivebeen asking for my own money scince XX/XX/XXXX. Theres No fraud, they know who I am. Ill even show them my liscence at a store if need be. Its utterly ridiculous to make me jump hoops. We will be in court. Thank you, XXXX XXXX\\n\"This letter is in regards to my mother, who is a former Capital One credit card holder. She has give me power of attorney so I am authorized me to act on her behalf. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, she called Capital One to pay off her balance and close her account. She was told she had to pay a {$21.00} fee to close the account, and she did so, paying a total of {$1100.00} over the phone. \\n\\nShe received a transaction statement for the period from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, acknowledging that payment and saying that Capital One owed her {$1.00}. Then another statement, for the period from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, claimed she owed {$30.00}. The following day, XX/XX/XXXX, I wrote to Capital One, explaining the situation and asking them to close her account and stop billing her. \\n\\nA few weeks later, she received another bill. Finally, in mid XXXX, I called Capital One and was told that the first time my mother called, the customer service rep made a mistake and my mother had not been given the amount of interest owed. That interest was continued to grow each month. The customer service rep said that she would erase the interest from the account, and my mother would owe nothing. Last week she received another bill for {$88.00}. \\n\\nI called again on today, XX/XX/XXXX. The rep on the phone had all of the information -- knew the entire history about the agreement to waive the interest fees -- and said that the previous rep had not completed the update properly. She assured me that it would now be taken care of and that a XXXX   balance would be reflected on the printed statement my mother receives within one or two billing cycles. Thats the part that makes me nervous because that is what I heard last month. She also said that the waiver of interest would not apply to future purchases or cash advances. However, the account was closed in XXXX, so there will no longer be any more transactionsonce they remove the {$88.00} interest payment from the account. My concern is that Capital One will keep charging interest on the interest it had charged before, in the hopes that my senior citizen mother will just give up and pay it.', 'I have been a member of Barclay \\'s XXXX credit card for at least ten or twelve years. I am fairly sure that some money was siphoned off about 10 years ago. Rather than fight with them over it, as I believe they went through an acquisition, I kept using the card to build up the 529 college savings  account. I wanted to at least give my granddaughter SOMETHING for books, at the very least! ( No thanks to this XXXX  scam of a credit card company ) I have gone online, called numerous times and done everything I can to get my XXXX   reward money earned put into my checking account, and get an email informing me of that transfer! Please look into this company. I think you will see that they are uncooperative at best and thieving reprobates, at worst.\\n\\nAlso, can you make them CALL ME, and get this straightened out? It seems they \\'ca n\\'t understand me \\' when I call!\"\\nI received only one letter that I had to paid a certain amount to keep my account open. I did pay the amount on time and been paying XXXX  every two weeks. On XX/XX/2020, I paid XXXX again and on XX/XX/2020 I paid XXXX dollars to catch up on my late payments. Not once I received a letter that my account was closed or was going to be closed. By XX/XX/2020 I was on schedule to finally paid off my late payments. With the virus damaging a lot of house, I am a XXXX XXXX  and was not looking for a closed account when I been on the card.\\nIn XXXX, XXXX, I was alerted by one of my credit monitoring systems that my score had decreased.

I\\'ve called 5 times, it\\'s the end of XXXX ( 5 months later ) and I still haven\\'t received the payment coupons. Everyone I talk to claim there was a problem with my address, they didn\\'t know which one to use, an employee didn\\'t make it completed in the system. It\\'s been one excuse after another. They managed to find my address just find to add the balance and show payments on my credit report. They managed to find the address correctly to send me mailers and letters in the mail to utilize the rest of the unused credit on the card, yet I can\\'t get my payment coupons in the mail! \\n\\nI would like to receive monthly statements or the payment coupons they promised me.\"\\nThis particular account situation that is lately filing on my own credit document has a seriously unfavorable relation to my personal ability to obtain a present loan application.

More confirmation of the aforesaid item too. My proper request must over, I was never 30 days/60 days/120 days late in any of my payments and I\\'m not greatly tuned in to the date opened so I prefer to ask you be investigated as soon as possible and confirmed to be correct. Thanks!\\nChase is charging me {$790.00} for a transaction that should not have had an extra charge. I had emergency XXXX while traveling in XXXX. The hospital required a temporary deposit of {$10000.00} euros ( on XX/XX/2019 ) which was returned when the insurance company verified payment ( on XX/XX/2019 ). My Chase credit card does not have foreign transaction fees - the amount debited in dollars should have been {$11000.00} because the euro to dollar exchange rate was XXXX on XXXX XXXX. Instead, they debited {$12000.00}. When the {$10000.00} euros was returned, they credited {$11000.00}, which was correct because the exchange rate was XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. As a result, I am disputing the extra charge of {$790.00}. I have contacted them by phone twice, by secure message with documentation, and by mail with documentation, and every time they give me a different reason for the fee and deny my request for the charge to be removed. I contacted the hospital, and they said they charged XXXX euros and returned XXXX euros so they did not get the extra money. Chase first said it was a difference in exchange rate so I showed them it wasn\\'t. Then they said we used a PIN for a cash advance - I don\\'t even have a PIN for the card, plus it was a purchase of hospital services, not a cash advance. They have not responded to my last letter ( XX/XX/2019 ) disputing their reasons - it has been a month with no response. I started my protests in XXXX, as soon as I got my statement and saw the mistake. I have attached their last denial letter, my response to the letter, and my Chase statement showing the debit and credit.\\nAmex wrongfully closed my XXXX XXXX credit card. At the time of closure, I had OVER XXXX in rewards in my account. Amex, in essence, stole over XXXX from me.\\nI wanted the card to get the six percent rewards on Apple products for holiday. I sent in all of my information the application requested via my XXXX, I removed the freeze from my credit report and included my drivers license ( front and back ) showing my current address. I was approved for the credit card with a {$15000.00} credit limit. I ordered the physical card which was received and activated. I used the mobile pay to make purchases at XXXX, a vending machine, XXXX, Apple Services, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX totally {$41.00}. I paid the account immediately, I dont like to carry balances. These purchases were made XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX when for no apparent reason my account was restricted and placed under review. I contacted Goldman Sachs numerous times since then, on one occasion I was asked a series of identifying questions regarding my car color, boat length and the city of my alma mater ( which was not listed ). I even sent pictures of my XXXX XXXX XXXX and my XXXX XXXX XXXX. I noticed that they pulled my credit report resulting in a hard inquiry which remains on my report for two years. They finally reported to XXXX the account in XXXX ( a full two months after the account was opened ). They reported I had a {$10.00} balance and to date there have been no updates. I do not have any balance. They are pulling credit, lowering scores doing so, they then restrict the account and their response to the inquiry is, After looking into the account I show that it is currently under review and we will be reaching out once the review is complete. This is now XXXX and still nothing. They are damaging my credit with an account that is not usable, with outdated information and sporadic reporting. They are not providing ANY information on timeframe to resolution, or, for that matter, simply no information at all. I was unable to get the six percent rewards back for my Apple holiday purchases. I feel they are scamming people for information, damaging consumers credit and simply not doing what one would expect from a credit card provider. Its all some sort of scam.\\nOn XX/XX/19 I applied for a XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX credit card issued my XXXX XXXX. A credit report was pulled on my XXXX  and the message was wait 2 weeks. Today XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter stating there is freeze on my XXXX  report and they are unable to verify my credit history with other credit grantors. Well the fact that they pulled my XXXX  report is clear they were able to verify my credit history. Since they said they couldn\\'t pull the report they wanted to use I want to remove the one they did pull and didn\\'t use.\\n\"I have a credit card with XXXX XXXX department store. My credit limit was {$2200.00} dollars with only one late payment reported on my credit history with the credit card. In XXXX, I received no mailer ( although they said that they mailed one ) that my credit limit was being decreased. The decrease was not due to my credit history with XXXX XXXX, but with a recent pull of my credit report. XXXX XXXX reduced my credit limit to just {$14.00} above my balance. This limit would be me over my new credit limit once the interest posts ( about $ XXXXmonth ) for the current month. When I called, the representative told me that the credit reporting agency determines the credit limit. After talking to a supervisor, they said that it was due to information received from the credit reporting agency. My issues and questions are as follows : 1. Why would XXXX XXXX pull my credit report again after establishing credit with them? \\n2. They do not offer automatic payment options ( only one time early schedule ) which seems predatory because then they have a greater chance of missed payment and increased fees. \\n3. Because they decided to decrease my limit, they have made it look like I have maxed out my credit limit ( which damages my credit ) when they actually decided to decrease it by {$800.00} in less than a week before statement cutoff time. Prior to the decrease, I used 59 % of my credit limit, after the decrease, I am 99 % of my credit limit.', \"On XX/XX/XXXX I purchased a flight to XXXX for me and my wife through Chase Ultimate Rewards online ( Itinerary # XXXX ). I noticed I selected the wrong flight on accident and immediately called into Chase to cancel. Chase canceled the flight, refunded my money and returned the points I used for the flight to my point bank. \\nI then booked my trip again using the correct flights ( Itinerary # XXXX ) The flight was with XXXX XXXX departing on XX/XX/XXXX The flight cost {$1900.00} per traveler for a total of {$3900.00} I redeemed XXXX of my travel points for {$1500.00} towards the flight reducing the total amount charged on my credit card to {$2400.00} On Monday, XX/XX/XXXX my wife and I decided to cancel our flight to XXXX due to her recovery from a XXXX  XXXX and our doctors guidance that international travel wouldnt be best given she is also XXXX. \\nThe customer service representative with Chase told me I would receive a credit for the total value of the flight from XXXX XXXX to be used on future flights before XX/XX/XXXX on XXXX. The rep also told me that if I mailed the doctors note to XXXX XXXX ( at the address she provided XXXX the reissue fee would be waived on an initial flight booked and would be waived on any future flights booked with the remaining balance of my credit. The rep also told me that I would receive an email confirming the credit balance. \\nI had not received an email from Chase so I called into Chase again at XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. The rep told me she would need to connect with XXXX to generate the refund but was unable to connect with them because they were so busy. She told me to call later that night because it would be slower and Id likely get through. \\nI called that night of XX/XX/XXXX. The rep told me I would receive the credit information by email and would also in 48 hours receive an email about a refund. She also told me that I could use the credit on multiple trips if I didnt use the whole balance on one trip. Additionally, she told me not to make any decisions about whether to use the credit until I received the email about the refund. \\nThe next day, XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from Chase confirming the amount of the credit. The email stated I would receive a credit of {$1900.00} per person with a {$300.00} reissue fee. \\nI did not receive an email about the refund by XXXX XXXX  on XX/XX/XXXX. Knowing I wanted to reschedule a domestic trip that wouldnt be taxing on my wife as soon as we could, I called into Chase to see the status of the refund email. The rep tried to pull up the notes about my issue but told me her system was rebooting. I waited on the call for 23 minutes until she finally told me to try again later that night. I called again at XXXX and there were still issues with their system. Fire alarms were also going off. \\nThe next morning of Thursday, XX/XX/XXXX, I called Chase at XXXX XXXX  to ask about the refund email. The rep I spoke with did not seem very competent and seemed confused about the notes. She stated that the original rep I spoke with had gotten my actual Itinerary # XXXX confused with the canceled # Itinerary # XXXX. I would not receive a refund for Itinerary # XXXX. I accepted this explanation as it seemed logical. \\nKnowing our ability to travel internationally ( and use the entirety of the {$1900.00} per person credit ) was not possible before XX/XX/XXXX and knowing we would likely reschedule a flight to XXXX XXXX that night, I wanted to confirm with the rep that I could use the credit for multiple trips like how the prior reps had told me. The rep told me I would forfeit the remaining balance of the credit if I did not use it all at once. On hearing this I asked to speak with her supervisors. \\nThe supervisor I spoke with listened to my issue and confirmed for me that I would be able to use the credit on an additional flight if there was a remaining balance after booking an initial flight with the credit. She also told me she would send me an email with instructions on how to attach and email the doctors note to have the reissue fee waived. In total, my call with Chase on the morning of XX/XX/XXXX took 1 hour and 26 minutes. \\nKnowing this information, my wife and I decided to book a short trip to XXXX XXXX. I first called Chase during my lunch break at XXXX on Thursday XX/XX/XXXX. They told me to call later because the wait to get to a rep who could apply my credit would be very long. On the night of Thursday XX/XX/XXXX I called back to book my flight at XXXX XXXX. I was on hold for over two hours before getting connected to a rep who could help me book my flight. \\nWhile on hold, I searched XXXX flights via the Chase Travel Rewards flight booking website. Nearly all the XXXX flights for economy fares on the dates we were looking to fly ( including the one I eventually booked ) were displaying prices between {$500.00} and {$680.00}. \\nEventually I was connected with a rep after a very long hold and was able to book an economy flight on XXXX to XXXX  XXXX departing XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and returning on XX/XX/XXXX. At multiple times during this I confirmed with the rep that I would be able to use the remaining balance of my credit after booking this flight to XXXX XXXX. Each time the rep confirmed this information. However, not once did the rep tell me the total value of the flight I was booking ( only the remaining value of my credit on my asking ). \\nFinally when the flight was booked, I asked the rep to confirm for me what the remaining balance of my credit was. He told me the residual amount was {$1300.00} per person. I also asked him to send me an email with this amount and he said one would arrive in 24-48 hours. The rep also told me there would be {$400.00} reissue fee on the flight that would be charged to my credit card. Having booked the flight we hung up and I received a non-standard looking itinerary emails for both me and my wife. The cost of the flight was not listed. \\nShortly after hanging up, the rep called me back to confirm some information about my wife. I gave him this information and also requested an itemized statement for my flight to XXXX XXXX to confirm the value and again asked for an email with the credit information. He told me again I would receive this information within 24-48 hours. \\nThe next morning I checked the charges on my Chase card. The {$400.00} reissue fee was listed from Chase but there were also two {$200.00} charges from XXXX as well. \\nSeeing this extra {$400.00} worth of charges from XXXX I called Chase on the morning of Friday XX/XX/XXXX. The rep I spoke to told me I needed to call XXXX. \\nOn calling the XXXX, the XXXX rep could not explain the charge either and told me to call Chase back. He also told me the only charge I should receive would be {$6.00} or some nominal amount. This made no sense to me as no one at Chase mentioned this. \\nI called Chase again on XX/XX/XXXX. At this point I was irate. Not only were there phantom charges on my credit card, but after speaking with the XXXX rep, I was worried somehow my flight to XXXX XXXX was booked at an extremely high price that was not told to me by the rep nor displayed anywhere on the Chase Rewards website when I was searching flights and used up the entirety of my credit ( hence why I owed delta {$6.00} ). When I was connected to the rep I explained all these issues, stated I wanted an email confirming the balance of my credit and also an itemized statement for my flight. The rep began asking me a bunch of questions. Having no patience at this point I immediately asked to speak to a supervisor. The woman explained to me she was a supervisor and that she was the same supervisor I spoke with the morning of XX/XX/XXXX. She confirmed that I would still receive the residual amount of my credit and that the residual amount was {$1300.00} per person. She said I should expect an email with this information within 24-48 hours. I asked why it takes so long and she said the people who send the emails are a different department so it takes longer. Satisfied that this information was all in my call notes and that I would receive an email confirming this, I got off the phone. \\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I finally received the credit information email from Chase. The email incorrectly stated ( contrary to what numerous Chase travel representatives had stated on my calls ) the remaining balance on the credit was {$680.00} per person. Irate, I responded back with the following message via email : This is INCORRECT. I was told our original credit was XXXX per person ( I have emails documenting this ) and we just used approximately XXXX per person on a trip to XXXX XXXX. The remainder is supposed to be around XXXX. At this point, given the terrible service I've received from Chase the past week I plan on reporting Chase to the FTC for unfair and deceptive trade practices. The number of false statements I've been told the past week is horrific. Please remember your calls are all recorded so there is plenty of evidence. \\nHaving no response to my angry email I called Chase on XX/XX/XXXX to confirm the remaining balance on my credit. I was bounced around multiple times because the original person I spoke to did not understand my original request. \\nEventually I spoke to a supervisor named XXXX. I explained the situation to her and she put me on hold for a long time while she reviewed the notes from the case. Eventually she asked me to go through what happened step by step so she could escalate this to higher ups, repeatedly noting that she would not be able to offer a resolution because she did not feel comfortable weighing in given how muddled this all was. This made me suspicious knowing that I sent the email above threatening a claim. I almost felt like they would use the information on my call with XXXX against me in any claim. Nonetheless, hoping to have this resolved between the parties, I walked through what had all transpired as XXXX took notes. She also brought up my angry email on the call. \\nEventually XXXX escalated to higher ups and assured me they would contact me the morning of XX/XX/XXXX. She told me my case number was XXXX and that my issue would be resolved the next morning. \\nAs of XX/XX/XXXX I have not received a call from Chase and my issue relating to the travel credits has not been resolved.\", 'On XX/XX/2019 I was charged a return payment fee of {$32.00} by Comenity. I contacted the customer service line on XXXX and spoke to a rep for approximately 11 minutes. I advised this rep that I was sure I had the money in the account and it was returned by error. I asked for a courtesy return credit as I have never had one and she stated she contacted her supervisor and that they would credit my account that {$32.00} fee back. I advised that was all I needed, to this date there has been no credit to my account. \\n\\nI was lied to by this bank and want the CFPB to take action on my behalf.

I am set-up for paperless billing and I had not received a statement, payment due notification, late statement, etc. I reached out to them to explain the circumstance and they claimed I received emails.

I clearly stated that I wanted it to be an upgrade of the current line of credit as the line I had with Wells Fargo was my oldest line of credit. The person I spoke to ensured that I would be under the same line of credit since everything was done in house. The employee stated I qualified for an upgrade, and I went through an application process. They said they would close my account and open up a new one, but they at no time said this also meant I would have my credit line closed and receive a hard inquiry on my credit score. This significantly impacted my credit score with XXXX and XXXX. I feel Wells Fargo either deceived me or gave me false information pertaining to my credit card upgrade as I would not have approved of the upgrade if I new it would lead to the closure of my oldest line of credit. Wells Fargo is already notorious for illegal practices, and I should have known they would willing deceive me for their own benefit.\\n\"Hello Consumer Finance. \\n\\nTried to purchase some cigars from XXXX XXXX XXXX for {$520.00}, and some shirts from XXXX XXXX for {$450.00} last Saturday XXXX and pay for them with our Capital One BUY POWER CARD Master Card. \\n\\nBoth Transactions were declined for payment.

We use our card regularly and pay our balances in full each month. We have had experiences in the past when the fraud department has contacted us because of an unusual or out-of-pattern purchase. We have either verified it was us and the charge would go through, or confirmed it was fraud and the card number would be shut down. I completely understand the need for these protections. \\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I used my Capital One Mastercard to make multiple purchases for upcoming birthdays and anniversaries. It is not unusual for me to make clusters of purchases at disparate vendors on a particular day. Given the current Corona virus situation, I am using my card even more and purchased a gift card at XXXX. The next purchase I made at XXXX XXXX was declined. I called Capital One right away. I had to go through several verification processes to confirm that I was the cardholder, including receiving a text message to my phone with a security code I had to give to the person I was speaking with at the time. After that, they could speak with me and the person indicated there was concern about several recent transactions on the account. I verified that the purchases were all initiated by me and were okay to process. I asked if I needed to redo the purchase at XXXX XXXX and I was told that, yes I would have to make the purchase again, but that the account was cleared now and it would go through. \\nI did so and the purchase was declined again. I thought that it might have been because I had used my phone, so I tried making the purchase from my computer and it was declined again. I might have tried once more before calling Capital One again. This time I was put through directly to the fraud department. The person at the fraud department said that there was suspicious activity and that they needed to verify some recent transactions with me. Again, it was the same purchases I had JUST verified with the person on my earlier phone call. She apologized and said this time I should not have a problem. I asked that she stay on the phone while I made the purchase and this time it did, in fact, go through. \\nShe then asked me if I wanted to receive text alerts for the account. That way, she told me, I would not have this happen to me again. Instead of being declined, I would receive a text message asking if a particular transaction was being initiated by me. I could text yes if it was mine and it would go through or I could text no if it was fraud and it would be declined. I told her that would great. She asked if the number they had on file was correct. It was not. It was a landline from when we had first opened the account 20 years ago. I gave her the new cell number, the one that I have been using to call them for over 7 years, the one they had just sent the text alerts to, and she made the change. \\nAll of the above, while time-consuming and a little annoying, was understandable given the conditions of the Corona virus lock-down. \\nThe real problem occurred on XX/XX/XXXX, when I was making purchases for my daughters and daughter-in-law for XXXX XXXX. I had decided to give gift cards to their favorite restaurants, trying to do my part to support those restaurants. The first transaction went through fine. The second was declined. I did NOT receive a text alert, allowing me to indicate that the transaction was mine ; it was just flat out declined. I called Capital One again. I went through the same verification process, including having a security code sent to my cell phone. Again, I was told there was suspicious activity on the account and again I verified it was me making the purchase. I was told that the account was cleared and I should repurchase the gift card. I explained what had happened five days earlier and asked the person to stay on the line while I re-entered the information. The transaction was declined again. \\nThis time the person I was speaking to said something to the effect, Oh, your account has moved into a higher level of authentication. Let me place you on a brief hold. \\nAfter five minutes, the person got back on the phone and told me that the only way the account could be unrestricted now was if I sent CapitalOne a photo of the back my husbands or my drivers license. I was astounded. I said I would not give them that information because of concerns over identity theft and the fact that the real ids we use now have bar codes and QR codes with all kinds of information associated with them. I asked if there was some other form of verification I could give, like a utility bill. They said no, only a photo of the back of the drivers license. I asked to speak to a manager. \\nI was connected to XXXX, a manager in Fraud & Disputes. She indicated that the elevated level of authentication had happened because the account had too many declined transactions. Mind you, none of the transactions CapitalOne had raised concerns about were actually fraud, and I had verified each of them. In fact, many of these declines were just repeats of the same transaction that CapitalOne had told me their system had cleared to process. \\nIt then occurred to me that I had never received the text alert on XX/XX/XXXX that was supposed to allow me the opportunity to verify that a suspicious transaction was indeed mine. Why hadnt that happened? When I spoke to the person on XX/XX/XXXX, she had indicated that she had set the account up do so. I had even received a text on XX/XX/XXXX confirming that my cell phone was going to be receiving texts, etc. from CapitalOne. XXXX said that that was another reason for the elevated authentication. The phone number had been changed on the account. I said that that was ridiculous because the person in the fraud department was the one who had made the change. She had done this because the phone originally associated with the account when it was opened was a landline. She needed to enter my cell phone number so I could receive text alerts. And the number she changed it to was the same number that CapitalOne was already sending the security codes to, so clearly it was in their system, associated with my account. XXXX said none of that mattered. The system had been flipped to an elevated authentication level and they would only accept the photo of the back of one of our drivers licenses to unlock the account. I was furious. About the only compliment I can give to CapitalOne at this point was that the several people I spoke with kept their cool. But that is it. There was no ability to look at the fact that their fraud detection system had failed. Now I was not able to use my credit card in the midst of a crisis that required even more frequent use of such credit cards in order to remain socially distant and safe. The only way to correct their systems error was to give information that I felt would put me at greater risk for identity fraud. I hung up. \\nAfter logging into my CapitalOne account online, I was going to close the account. I had a sizable number of miles that I was going to use first and then I was going to pay the difference in the amount due. However, CapitalOne had locked down my miles as well. So now, I couldnt even close my account without losing a great deal of money I had already earned. There was no need for the lock down of my miles to occur. Obviously they were still accepting my payments and this was just a form of payment. Those miles were earned on transactions that had already been paid for and I was using them to pay down the account balance. There was no fraud risk to CapitaOne.\\n\\nI called CapitalOne again. This time I spoke with XXXX, a manager in the same department. While she agreed with everything I said, she told me she could do nothing. I asked what happened when they received the photo of the back of my drivers license, what switch was flipped so-to-speak, that allowed my account to operate without restriction? I asked, if knowing that the fraud system had failed, why couldnt she override the restriction and put notes into the account indicating why she had done so. She said she would be fired if she did that. What kind of company does not empower their employees to override a failed system, especially with a customer who has been with them for 20 years?! So then, I asked if she could release the lock on my miles so I could pay my bill and close the account, explaining my rationale that there was absolutely no fraud exposure to CapitalOne here. The payment would be going to my account, nowhere else. She said she was unable to help me. I hung up again and called the CFPB to find out how to register a complaint. \\nBefore writing this, I tried one more time to contact CapitalOne. This time I called Customer Service rather than the fraud department. I asked for a manager and was transferred to XXXX, an Account Dispute Manager. He basically told me that their fraud system was acting correctly. I asked him if I should expect, as a cardholder, to make a purchase, have it declined, call to verify with the fraud department that it was me making the purchase, be told that the account was cleared to make that purchase again, to go ahead and make the purchase and then to have the transaction declined again. Not only that, but to have my account locked down until I gave them a photo of the back of my drivers license. He said that apparently the system was still concerned about the purchase. I admit, I was angry and probably rude. I assume there are recordings of all these phone calls. I hope so. I have screen shots of the call details as well as the texts to my cell that include the security codes I was sent and the notice about receiving texts from CapitalOne. I will include these as substantiation of my story. \\nAt one point, all I wanted was for my account status to be returned to normal without having to send the photo of the back of the drivers license. I had been a happy customer at CapitalOne for 20 years. But I have spent too much time on the phone and too much time changing all of my automatic payments tied to CapitalOne, hoping that I catch them all before the next billing cycle, and too much time writing this. \\nI no longer have any faith in CapitalOne as my credit card company. The only acceptable resolution for me is to be allowed to apply the full value of my reward miles against my balance, regardless of how long ago any travel purchases were made. I will then pay the remaining balance and close the account. I want a written statement from CapitalOne that this account was closed by me because of my complaint regarding how this was handled. I want to make sure that there is no negative report made to any credit bureaus regarding this closure. I expect an immediate resolution. \\nThank you for allowing me to air this complaint.', 'About XX/XX/XXXX we ( my wife ) received an unsolicited offer through the mail from US Bank for their branded \"\" ReliaCard \\'\\' debit card.

They are denying my claim for fraudulent charges on my Wells Fargo Business Credit Card. I was alerted to this issue on XX/XX/2019, almost two full weeks after the card was reported stolen, was closed, and I was told not to worry about the charges by the representative.\\n\\nMy complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has many components which I have outlined below, but first and foremost it is regarding the denial of claim for fraudulent charges made on XX/XX/2019 totaling {$22000.00} USD that now I am being held responsible for. \\n\\nHelpful people from almost every other department and branch in Wells Fargo outside of the fraud the Wells Fargo Fraud Department, have expressed disgust, surprise, and utter disappointment that I am being held responsible for these charges. \\n\\nGiven the evidence supplied in the Credit Card Fraud Evidence document attached to this complaint, as well as the simple fact that their own team approved the fraud claims on my Wells Fargo Business Debit card, there is no reason to close and deny my claim. The only acceptable resolution is that all of these charges be permanently removed from my account for the Wells Fargo Business Credit Card in dispute. \\n\\nI have further complaints in the matter regarding the manipulative, unhelpful, untimely, strong-arm tactics that that fraud team resorted to when the denial was issued. I was immediately made out to be the criminal, despite being the innocent party who has been a long a valued customer. Im asking for a full review and investigation of practices used to deliver or address customers who have had a denial of fraud claims and an apology for the conduct of the fraud team. It is my opinion and the opinion of those I have spoken to within Wells Fargo at various levels that this specifically due to the dollar value of the fraud and that my claim has been denied without a proper investigation of the facts before denying the claim. \\n\\nAdditionally, in the case of fraud and a police investigation into the charges, time matters. After repeated questions to the representatives who handled my case on XX/XX/XXXX, I was repeatedly told that I didnt need to worry about anything and that the charges were obvious fraud and that Wells Fargo would take care of everything. Nearly two weeks later, after I called to inquire why the fraudulent charges were placed back on my card, they suggested that I would need to potentially provide unlimited and unspecified amounts of evidence to support my case. I was also told that no matter what evidence I supplied, there would be no guarantee of any results that would positively affect the decision in my favor. This is a tactic that I believe was used to stall and make the task seem insurmountable, demeaning, and potentially fruitless in order to scare and intimidate the customer from pursuing further action. However, I immediately supplied the evidence I could gather as a civilian and launched additional police reports beyond the initial XXXX XXXX Sheriff 's report for the theft of my wallet, cards, and phone from my vehicle on XX/XX/2019. There are currently several police departments across various locations where the charges occurred investigation the matter. The fraud team repeated claims theyre unable to supply the transaction times necessary to the ongoing investigation, hampering the multiple active and ongoing police investigations. Yet the fraud supervisor read off several transaction times to me on the phone when we originally spoke. I still have yet to receive a call back from the original supervisor I had called regarding the issue, nearly a week after leaving a message with him. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/2019 I spoke to two representatives in the resolution department related to my case, who promised that it would be escalated and the team would be actively working to get the denial reversed and the investigation reopened. Yet, on Monday, XX/XX/2019 when I called again, the case had yet to be assigned. When I spoke with the new representative, she took on the case, but made no promises and was sorry someone told me incorrectly that they had the power to do what the previous representative had stated. After supplying all of the evidence, I called back two hours later, only to find the representative had still failed to contact the internal fraud department, and therefore I opted to begin contacting federal authorities and watchdog groups about the case. \\n\\nRESOLUTION : Again, the only acceptable resolution is that all of the fraudulent charges filed be permanently removed from my account for the Wells Fargo Business Credit Card in dispute and that any negative marks on my business or personal credit or accounts be removed. \\n\\nA resolution does not mean that I will not continue to pursue action against Wells Fargo for the losses and harm this has caused to my business, my family, and my health. Additionally, it does not mean that I will not also pursue action to stop the abhorrent practices of Wells Fargo related to denial of claims without proper investigation. What has happened to me should never happen to anyone again. \\n\\nI have attached the list of fraudulent charges, Credit Card Fraud Evidence supplied to Wells Fargo, and additional Well Fargo complaint documentation with notes I have been keeping to build the case against Wells Fargo and support my claim.\", 'I was feeling rushed checking out a Target, and the nice teenager checking me out asked if I had a Target card and briefly explained that I could save whatever percent if I signed up for one ; I was buying something expensive, so I tentatively said yes and started signing up. \\n\\nI should have known to stop the process when the employee told me that this would be a huge relief to her, as there was a huge amount of pressure being put on them to push the cards from management. The predatory marketing issue here is that this absolutely seems like you\\'re signing up for a loyalty/savings store card ( as is common at store check-outs ) when it is in fact a credit card. Target employees had either poorly trained on explaining how the card works or instructed to be intentionally misleading. I finally stopped when the prompt screens began asking income information and for my social security number, but then my checkout person repeatedly assured me that this would not affect my credit and I would not receive a bill if I just didn\\'t activate the card -- so I went ahead, just trying to get out of line and get a discount, thinking I had paid with my normal credit card I\\'d swiped. \\n\\nI genuinely believe that she just didn\\'t understand how it worked, and we were both in a hurry ; credit cards are serious legal agreements with financial consequences that can follow people and their families forever -- they should not be sold at check-out like pack of gum.

The company sent a response letter to an address that again was fraudulent and used to obtain the accounts in the first place. Many years ago in XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX Chase opened and allowed a thief to open Credit cards, and 2 Checking and 2 Savings accounts in my name. This was an Identity Thief that opened these accounts. I advised Chase of such, and Provided Chase with a Law Enforcement Identity Theft Affidavit. Chase considered my documents a Joke, and didn\\'t properly investigate the issue. I received a letter from Chase on my response with of course that fraudulent address again ( had to pull the letter from CFPB. ) Which stated that the Credit Card ( s ) Were closed due to Fraud and that a thief had in fact applied and obtained those products. As well as the checking and savings accounts. I have not applied for any Chase products, Nor did I ever obtain these physical cards and or any documentation related to the Credit cards or Checking account ( s ). These accounts have been blocked and removed from my credit reports and Chase sent a letter to me a few months ago to my actual correct address advising me that the Cards were charged off due to fraud. The whole purpose in my last complaint was because chase is not actually conducting investigations nor are they doing what they say they are on the letters they send to consumers. I have never banked with Chase, nor do I have a banking relationship or relationship with the bank at all. I was originally scheduled to be hired a few months, ago. I passed the background check no issues, when it got to their \"\" Security Scan \\'\\' After they hired me. I find out that they stated I had some checking account that was closed with the bank and that I couldn\\'t be hired. When I advised them that this was fraud again they did not care and nor did they investigate. If they had actually investigated they can clearly see my Drivers License address, Issued date, and Signature do not match the ID they have on file which was filed as Fraud. Additionally, I finally have corrected the Fraud off my Credit Report and Applied for my first ever credit card with Chase Application # XXXX. Chase pulled my credit and the Analyst recommended it for Approval. It went to some other analyst who Denied it with the reason being \"\" Unsatisfactory Relationship with the bank \\'\\' \"\" Too many applications for Credit \\'\\'. Now Again this unsatisfactory relationship stems from those Credit Cards that WERE FRAUD and OPENED BY A THIEF. In the past. I have a letter confirming those accounts were fraud and these accounts are not on my consumer credit reports, which I will be happy to provide to Chase as well. Chase has not worked with me to resolve any of the fraud. They continue to state, that these Checking accounts were authorized and when in fact they were not. I have been working to resolve the Identity theft for many years. Hence why I have a Fraud Alert on all 3 Credit Bureaus. Please review the documentation and if anything is requested I will be happy to comply with the investigation and provide further documentation on such crime.', 'To From It May Concern, My name is XXXX XXXX.

To pay the bill, I can go through the Chase credit card website and it automatically draws the payment from my Bank Account. The payment normally takes several hours to be completed, although they do state that it can take up to two business days. I normally schedule the payment two days in advance of when my payment is due to ensure that it is received on time, taking into account weekends and how many business days there are before the first of the month. \\n\\nI have made payments for this credit card on time for every single month. However, on at least four instances, the credit card is saying payments have been late, and they charge a late fee and interest charge. For the first two instances, I know I made the payments on time, but the company said it was posted late and so they charged fees. When I found out, I called the credit card company and spoke to their customer service representative, and eventually after talking to supervisors they acknowledged that their system inappropriately delayed when the payment was shown as posting, and so they refunded the late fees and interest charged. More recently for this past XXXX, it occurred again. And then for XXXX, I went online and made the payment, but when I got my statement for XXXX recently, it\\'s saying that the payment was never received and so it charged late fees and interested for both XXXX and XXXX. I am tying to talk to them to get them to address these situations as well and am hoping they will resolve it, but it\\'s now seeming to be a pattern. And I have heard from others who have this credit card ( and other credit cards ) that they experience this as well. I don\\'t know if it\\'s just errors in these companies \\' systems, or if it is purposeful as a way for them to collect late fees and interest charges from unsuspecting customers. I am lucky in that I am familiar with consumer protections laws and so know how to call them and challenge them, but I worry that many consumers won\\'t notice or won\\'t know how to challenge them and so just pay them. I am wondering if others have complained about this to CFPB and so perhaps it is in fact a pattern that requires investigation?

I have contacted discover multiple times for them to investigate and every time I get a response to give them 6 weeks to re-open the investigation. They never contact me back and then I have to reach out and for them to tell me that there was no additional information that would allow them to investigate further. It seems as though there is no effort in their investigation and it is simply convenient for them to place the blame on me.

American Express failed to properly investigate these billing disputes. Several disputes filed were for hotel billing errors such as inquiry XXXX for XXXX XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$520.00}. The amount in dispute is due to an overbilling, and double billing and payment for stays made by other methods. American Express was provided ample evidence to support my claim, including documents showing stays where paid using reward points, a letter from the hotel stating a charge was made in error as the stay was paid for using reward points, a listing of my stays as reported by XXXX who managed the hotel, a letter from the hotel stating I'd receive a refund which was never provided for a night I was billed for but was not a guest and more. Provided with written documents from the hotel acknowledging and refusing to correct the billing error should have been more than enough to settle this claim in my favor. AMEX failed to correctly investigate and/or file and process this billing dispute as required by federal law, the interchange and member agreements. \\nClaim XXXX and XXXX for the XXXX XXXX XXXX disputing {$580.00} and {$150.00} of the total charged was also not properly handled, investigated or processed. The hotel was provided with my reservations which clearly showed a much lower rate. The rate reserved was verified by two hotel representatives as being valid upon check-in. After I checked out of the hotel, however, the property changed the rate of my reservation without my knowledge or approval, demanding I violate federal in order for them to honor the agreed upon, validated and original accepted rate. American Express originally misplaced the documents provided and I re-asserted the dispute multiple times as they were closed out stating no evidence provided in error. After AMEX took their adverse action based on events of reported identity theft and closed my account. All the open disputes were closed immediately. Attempts to reopen the unprocessed or incorrectly processed disputes were closed the same day without being reviewed.

Proof of attempted return and subsequent refusal was provided to AMEX. The Platinum American Express Card I had also provided a benefit for return protection. This benefit covered purchases which merchants failed to accept and all returns were made and reported within this time frame. AMEX refused to investigate or process this benefit or asserted billing error, closing the opened cases right after they closed the card. And on subsequent reassertions closed the cases the same day, without review. \\n\\nThe {$3200.00} in billing errors which Amex failed to properly process or investigate represent the majority if not all the original remaining balance on my card. Which while the charges were disputed I was not obligated to pay.

I paid Amex for the transactions I could identify. However, I could not recognize some of the other transactions. I called the vendors and asked them for receipts ; however, this being 5 years ago they could not help me either.

I have an unblemished credit history always paying my accounts on time. However, they have now tarnished it. The only way to communicate with Amex is by speaking to their outsourced reps residing outside US who have very limited authority and knowledge.

My understanding was that my interest rate would be reduced for a period of twelve ( 12 ) calendar months beginning XXXX XX/XX/XXXX and ending XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. As a condition of the agreement, it was my understanding that I needed to bring my account current and make an immediate payment. I made the payment amount as scheduled per the attached payment schedule. I believed that my payment due dates were now modified per the agreement such that they would now be due at the end of each month. \\n\\nMy account was current as of XXXX XX/XX/XXXX and my understanding per the one-page enrollment confirmation I received was that I needed to have money in the account by the due date. I believed that the due date was no commensurate with the pre-scheduled payments. \\n\\nAround XXXX XX/XX/XXXX Discover attempted to make an ACH debit in line with the attached schedule. The debit was declined by my banking institution on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. I would not become aware of the issue until Discover reported adverse credit history marking my XX/XX/XXXX payment thirty ( 30 ) days  past-due. \\n\\nAround the beginning of XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Discover and explained the situation to the customer service representative. He responded by telling me that he wished I would have entered into the interest rate reduction on the phone rather than online. Because the scheduled payment dates per the attached were not actually the due dates for my account, and that my payments we still due at the beginning of each month. What he additionally explained is that the interest rate is apparently reduced by increasing the amount of the first payments due on the payment schedule, effectively spreading a single estimated payment over multiple other payments. He then admitted that the system can sometimes assign a date at random that is not commensurate with the due date, but that when entering into the program over the phone, that option doesn\\'t always exist. I explained to him that the practice seemed predatory and if as an XXXX   with advanced degrees I was fooled by the quantitative manipulation, I could imagine that others would be as well. I asked to be transferred to a supervisor and he obliged. \\n\\nThe supervisor I spoke with identified herself as XXXX. My understanding was that I was speaking to her on a recorded line. I explained to her what my experience had been and how I was blindsided by the adverse credit history given the payment schedule. My payment was due XXXX XX/XX/XXXX and was returned XXXX XX/XX/XXXX -- it was therefore factually inaccurate to report my account as being thirty ( 30 ) days past-due. \\n\\nI further explained to XXXX that I was a XXXX XXXX and as such I am required to dispute any factual inaccuracies within my credit files with the CRAs. I told her that it I would rather solve the matter with Discover Card, than resort to disputing thru the CRAs. I explained that I had no idea that the due date of my payment was entirely different than the scheduled payment date and cited the payment schedule and letter I\\'d received regarding the modified payment schedule. I cited the prior representative I\\'d spoken with and his explanation that enrolling in the program thru the website didn\\'t make what was going on clear. \\n\\nXXXX became defensive. She began yelling over and over again about how she and Discover Card would continue reporting the adverse credit history to the CRAs and that I was in violation of my card agreement. I tried to explain again how what I was being told by her didn\\'t make sense. She continued to yell. \\n\\nI asked XXXX to transfer me to another supervisor that would be able to assist me further -- she refused, stating that \"\" Discover Card \\'\\' internal policy would not allow her to transfer me to a supervisor. I asked again o be transferred to another supervisor and stated that I would be filing a complaint. XXXX again refused to transfer me to another supervisor. I informed her that I would be disconnecting the line and calling back XXXX continued to use every tactic possible to keep me on the line, berating me for being alleged violation of the card agreement. She continued to yell into the pone telling me that I could file a complaint against her all I wanted to and that Discover Card would continue to report the adverse credit history. I disconnected the line with her still yelling and me continuing to say \"\" good-bye, ma\\'am. \\'\\' I called back within half an hour later. I explained to the representative what had just happened and additionally that I have never been treated so poorly by Discover Card in the fifteen ( 15 ) years I\\'ve held a card. This representative apologized for the ordeal, stated that she would take my complaint against XXXX and file it. She stated that I could be transferred upstairs to speak with a supervisor again. She stated that she didn\\'t know why given the issues with enrollment within the program I was speaking of, and it being an issue card holders have raised before, that XXXX and I couldn\\'t reach an agreement. She did offer at her level to apply a one-hundred dollars statement credit for my trouble. I declined, indicating my concern that such an offer would constitute satisfaction and accord with my ultimate concern being the adverse credit history. Ultimately I told the representative that I wasn\\'t even sure I\\'d be keeping a credit card with the Card side of Discover Bank because of the interaction. I thanked the representative and disconnected the line. \\n\\nAround a month later I called Discover to inquire about the status of the complaint I\\'d filed. The representative stated that she could see where a complained had been filed against XXXX on my behalf. I additionally explained to the representative about the underlying issue and she too stated that I was not the only one to  complain about the program. I requested that a supervisor contact me regarding my experience. The representative update the information and acknowledged my request for a call back regarding the issue with XXXX. Six months later I have yet to receive a call from Discover regarding either my underlying concern or experience with XXXX. \\n\\nDiscover Card touts its standing as the credit card issuer \"\" Ranked Highest in Customer Satisfaction with Credit Card Companies as reported by XXXX.

My card was declined. I logged in to my XXXX app and learned that my credit card account was restricted. I spoke to the customer service agent with Capital One, who informed me that there was a bankruptcy associated with my account. I assured the representative that I had never filed for bankruptcy and that was inaccurate. The representative then transferred me to a supervisor who informed me that someone would get in touch with me in a few business days with the resolution, or I could call to check the status of the issue. The representative, XXXX, said that she would email the bankruptcy department to have them investigate this. \\n\\nMy account was reinstated so I did not follow up with Capital One at that time. Today, XX/XX/2019, I checked my account to ensure that my auto pay transaction completed as scheduled, and saw that my account was again restricted.

I was told that they did not have that information. I asked for the attorney \\'s name. I did not receive that information. I was told that they receive information on the filing of a bankruptcy in one of two places : the customer or the attorney. I did not notify capital one of a bankruptcy I did not file.

I was told after almost an hour on hold that they could not give me any information without getting the information from the bankruptcy department. The bankruptcy department was already contacted On XX/XX/XXXX, and this information should be readily available to me, the consumer, especially after a previous complaint. This treatment of a customer of over 10 years, with an account in good standing as well as an auto loan that seems to be unaffected by this erroneous problem, is wholly unacceptable and I intend to tell anyone considering doing business with Capital One to reconsider.\"\\nI bought items with my Chase credit card on Amazon for {$86.00} I returned all items to Amazon.They given me a gift card instead of putting on my Chase credit card as a negative.Spoken and sent all information to Amazon and Chase not resolved with both parties.

Then I started receiving letters with a bill and then one stating that my account had been closed to further purchases until I paid off the balance. Continuously making payments monthly I looked at my credit report and I saw that there was a SYNCB/PAYPAL Credit Card account on it but the account stated that it was closed. However, daily like 4 to 5 times a day I would get calls from them about the debt and I would make minimum payments to keep down the calls until I noticed that they wasn\\'t even reporting it to the credit agencies correctly. I noticed that they would never allow the late payments to go past 90-120 days of me missing payments even if I did ( this was in order to ensure it never gets charged off ).

It is an attempt to collect the sum of {$320.00} on the behalf of the sub prime high risk financial service provider Syncrony Bank/Wal Mart Credit Card. I was solicited and encouraged numerous times to accept a credit card from this organization. Having already known of their dubious track record for predatory lending, their constant barrage of unsolicited offers and promotional gimmicks were always simply deleted or ignored. To be clear : I NEVER agreed, responded, signed, committed to verbally or otherwise, received, activated, utilized, or have ever even seen in any other form or fashion a {$200.00} limit Wal Mart store credit card from Syncrony, XXXX, or any other financial institution. Accepting or even considering utilizing a credit card/store card line of credit limited to {$200.00} coupled with such astronomically high interest rates and worse still, limited to use at only one place of business makes absolutely no sense for me personally. I am a homeowner with a mortgage and several revolving type credit cards from actual reputable financial institutions with much higher credit limits and take my financial obligations very seriously. Therefore I strive to remain diligent about maintaining my financial well being. To my shock and horror I was only recently made aware that not only did Syncrony bank send me a Wal Mart credit card anyways, they then falsely tried to extort me into paying them for issuing a card that I absolutely DID NOT AGREE TOO, SIGN, TRY TO USE OR ACTIVATE. I WAS NOT ISSUED NOR DID I CREATE A PIN NUMBER. Approximately 14 months have passed since their solicitations and any and alll communication between either party or I have ceased. Then last month I purchased a new vehicle. Having made every single payment of every form ( with the exception of 1 house payment that was 14 days late 6 years and 3 months ago ) was always a sense of pride for me. Then I got a shock I wont soon forget when my banks auto loan pre approval letter had my interest rate nearly a full percentage point higher than expected. When I called for an explanation I was told that my XXXX report had a charge off listed under Syncrony Bank, I checked XXXX, they had reported 13 months of serious delinquency for what I still have no idea. Ive called, emailed, written, faxed, and sent a certified letter demanding an explanation and have received absolutely no response. The one time I was able to get someone on the phone after an hour and a half on hold, they couldnt assist me without an account number. Since your account number is apparently the number on the physical card which I did not nor hve ever possessed, I have no idea what that number is or why I would even have one associated with me. This ordeal has run its corse and I am beyond sick and tired of trying to get this resolved. This supposedly {$200.00} credit card, which they are now trying to extort {$320.00} for has cost me far more ; in increased interest on my {$40000.00} auto loan and in wasted time and effort. Syncrony Banks business model of handing out credit cards to anything with with hands and a heartbeat, and tricking them into trap loans and never ending fees must be working on someone, but Ill give my last dime to my attorneys before I give one red cent to Synchrony Bank or XXXX. They have advised me to, after filing this complaint with the CFPB ; cease attempting to contact and forward all future correspondence from Synchrony Bank and/or anyone acting on their behalf to their offices.\\nSee attatched Fraud Report UNAUTHORIZED TRANSACTIONS of XX/XX/XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX I just recieved XX/XX/XXXX.

XXXX repeated the amount and verified the account I wanted the payment to come out of. I had to verbally give him permission to make the payment. He stated the payment was made as of the XXXX but I wouldn\\'t see the available balance until two days.

The second attachment shows my statement summary of the account with a statement balance of XXXX and a payment of only {$27.00}.

The cashier told me that payment was reject, which was extremely embarrassing for me and also confusing because I had just paid my last bill. \\n\\nI called up my account and found I only had {$1.00} available, which I found peculiar as I had paid my last bill ahead of schedule. I checked with my bank and payment had already been debited. I have no history of delinquency with this card, either. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with the customer service department for Synchrony XXXX Mastercard and was informed that there was a hold on my card until XX/XX/XXXX. I was given several explanations, including that this is routine for cards that are less than six months old ( mine was issued five months ago ) and that the company was waiting five days for the funds to clear the bank. This answers were weird because ( 1 ) I\\'ve been using credit cards since 1982 and never encountered a situation where my account is frozen despite being diligent with payments, and ( 2 ) Synchrony received payment on XX/XX/XXXX and my bank account has already been debited. One manager named XXXX refused to connect me to her supervisor, despite my asking six times. \\n\\nI could understand putting a hold on my account if I had a history of delinquency or bounced checks, but I pay my bills in full and ahead of schedule. \\n\\nNo one I spoke to in the customer service operation would lift the hold, with everyone claiming that it was \"\" in the system \\'\\' - as if the company was run by self-thinking computers and no one could access data.

These purchases were not made by me and I have no knowledge of who made them. Bank of America has rejected my fraud claim on the grounds that an EMV chip was used and therefore the physical card was used for the purchase. This reason for rejection is illogical and invalid as I have informed Bank of America on multiple occasions that I have a missing credit card both before and after the fraudulent transactions occurred. Events are as follows : ~XX/XX/XXXX : I applied for and was approved for a new credit card with Bank of America ~XX/XX/XXXX : I call  Bank of America and inform them I have not received my credit card. They ask me if the card was lost or stolen and I respond by stating that the only information I have is that I have not received it. They say the will send me a new card expedited with the same account number. Phone records show me calling Bank of America on this date. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX : I receive the replacement card via XXXX and activate the new card. I have still not received the original card. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX : At XXXX XXXX CT I receive an email from Bank of America entitled Security Alert : Unusual Credit Card Activity Detected.

After checking my account, I notice the mentioned fraudulent charges. At XXXX CT, I place a call to Bank of America confirming that the charges are indeed fraudulent. During the call, the agent even states to me that an individual identifying himself as me, but calling from a different number, had called Bank of America earlier in the day to remove the fraud alert but was rejected. They ask me if I know how the fraud could have occurred and I explained the same as I have explained here. I.E. That 2 copies of my card were sent by Bank of America and I only received one of them, meaning the missing card could have been intercepted and used. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX : Three fraudulent credit card applications are placed in my name with other banks. This is not directly related to Bank of America but I mention it as I believe it was committed by the same perpetrator. I have contacted the Credit Bureaus and respective banks to report the frauds. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX : I am informed that Bank of America has rejected my fraud claim on the grounds that an EMV chip was used for the transaction.

This month \\'s statement indicated a past due balance and current balance, requesting minimal payment for {$160.00}. When speaking with customer service and also a live chat agent today, I was told that I made late payments, although, for the past 13 months, I have made my payments. I was informed today that the reason for the late payments were that I was paying my account ahead of the due date of the XXXX and making payments before a statement is generated ( penalized {$110.00} ). This is not acceptable billing practice. I also have two additional Synchrony accounts which I pay the exact same way, at same time. I pay majority of my bills at either the last day of the month or by the XXXX of each month as I have receive my income once a month, at the end of each month. I had asked Synchrony to remove all the late charges from my account, they only removed one, {$39.00}. I do not want to pay the additional late fees ; I was NOT late. I paid my monthly due payment of {$48.00} only today and I am now asking your assistance to resolve this issue ( which I consider to be fraudulent charges ). I did not make any changes to my Rooms to Go account with Synchrony ; I have been making my payments the same way each month, on their payment portal, and now all of a sudden they are charging me a total of {$110.00} in late fees.

The {$27.00} late fee is exorbitant and impacts those least able to afford it. \\n\\nExperience with XXXX has definitely not been a consumer-friendly one.

I opened a fraud claim in early XXXX with Chase and they\\'ve investigated into this issue. \\n\\nChase was able to identify that the fraudulent transaction had occurred over the phone. The fraudulent party was able to spoof my phone number and bypass through Chase \\'s identity verification process to perform a manual withdrawal of my reward points and have them converted to cash and deposited into the XXXX savings account mentioned above. Although Chase had agreed that this is a fraudulent transaction, there has been an internal decision to ignore the claim. They are unwilling to resolve the dispute and return my points. \\n\\nI was then told that there was an internal review my account and an internal decision has been made for Chase to end their relationship with me as of XX/XX/2019 and because of that, this fraud claim will not be resolved. Chase is unwilling to take responsibility and help resolve a fraudulent transaction that took place prior to this decision to end the relationship. I\\'ve been a client of Chase for over 14 years - I have no issues with the company \\'s decision to end their relationship with me ; however, I should be entitled to the rewards points back that I\\'ve earned through the program that were fraudulently taken from me. \\n\\nI\\'ve spoken to several personal bankers, Private Client bankers and even a branch manager about my case ( XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX branches ). They\\'ve been assisting me with escalating this situation ; however, Chase corporate will not take responsibility to resolve the claim. \\n\\nMy identity has been clearly compromised and Chase has failed to protect its consumers from fraud. I\\'m very disappointed in the decision and am looking to escalate this further to bring light to this matter and protect other consumers that may have gone through this similar event.\"\\nAs part of the Equifax Hack earlier this year, my information was stolen from their database in attempts to open a new Credit line.\\n\"On XX/XX/XXXX by phone I tried to redeem points to pay {$1000.00} on my Am Ex account.

XXXX XXXX', 'Hello XXXX XXXX, I believe that TD Bank / Card Services discriminates against minority customers and provides false information regarding denial of services. I cancelled my credit card with them today, XX/XX/19, because I was falsely denied my request for a credit line increase. Their excuse was my credit report from XXXX  showed \"\" multiple delinquent accounts \\'\\' however, when I logged into my XXXX  account there were no such delinquencies. Neither were there any delinquencies in my XXXX  or XXXX   reports. I spoke to supervisors in TD Customer Service and XXXX in TD Credit Services who both contradicted one another. I then contacted XXXX and spoke to their fraud department who confirmed that are no such delinquencies in my credit report and could not explain how TD Card Services came to their decision. \\n\\nThis is actually the second time, I\\'ve been denied a credit line increase by TD Card Services. I was denied XX/XX/2019 because my account had apparently not been opened long enough and I was told I could reapply after XX/XX/2019. Not only has my credit score gone up since my initial request for a credit line increase but I actually was approved and received an XXXX XXXX credit card with a higher credit line at the end of XX/XX/2019. This is the 3rd time that TD Card Services have engaged in improper business practices. They initially ruled in favor of a merchant in regards to a transaction dispute and didn\\'t notify me of their decision. TD then reversed their decision 2 days after I paid the remaining balance and again, did not notify me of THAT decision until after I called to inquire why I had a {$900.00} balance. Then when I requested the balance be returned to me, they did not do so until nearly 2 1/2 weeks later and after I made numerous inquiries as to when they mailed that payment out.\"\\nAt the beginning of XX/XX/2019 American Express cancelled both of my accounts I had with them while I was having medical issues after being less than 45 days late. At the time I was notified I called immediately and was told that the accounts had been closed 3 days prior to me having received notice in the mail. I believe american express timed the delivery of my notification in an effort to subvert my ability to make a timely payment so that they prematurely close my account. 2. After seeing that the account was closed I began making regular payments to buy time until I could pay off the balance in full. On XX/XX/2019 I paid off both of my accounts in full through their online portal and showed a XXXX balance on both of them. today XX/XX/2019 I began receiving collections calls at XXXX XXXX and as of the time of this complaint I have received 4 calls informing me that I have a balance on my american express accounts in the amounts of approximately {$13.00} and {$37.00} respectively. After learning this I immediately call american express to find out how I had a balance in collections for two accounts that had been paid in full only 11 days ago. I was told that the balance was interest that had accused after my final payment. I then asked how I was supposed to know that they had added interest to an account that from my perspective had been closed and paid in full if they had not given me notice. I was told that they had mailed me 4 separate pieces of mail attempting to collect the debt. I find this very hard to believe given the very short time frame from when I paid in full to when I began receiving collections calls. 11 days seems to be a very unreasonable amount of time for someone to be sent to collections. I was made to feel as though I was attempting to not pay off the account. On XXXX XXXX I paid off nearly {$4000.00} between the two accounts and I would submit that given the amounts and my attempt to fix the damage that this has done to my credit it does not make sense that I would have avoided only {$50.00} of Nearly {$4000.00} debt. I find these practices despicable and I believe they are motivated by discrimination based on the fact that one of my accounts is an american express optima account. The Optima account was an account that american express was forced to create and offer to consumer who where included in a legal settlement that was reached following a suit filed for similar unfair practices by american express. It is my belief that american express wanted nothing more that any excuse to be able to cancel the accounts of Optima card holders and found my short lapse during my illness to take advantage of the situation.\\nMy XXXX, XXXX and XXXX Credit File is showing a past due amount of {$260.00} and a balance of {$370.00} for a Citgo Credit Card that show as a chargeoff account. I received a notice from a Collection Agency that they are handling this account. Synchrony Bank is reporting Inaccurate information, if the account has been transferred or sold to a third party for collection, it should not be reporting a balance or a past due amount. Under the FCRA guideline this is a clear Violation. I would like to have this Inaccurate information deleted from all three of my credit files. This is impacting my ability to obtain credit due to the incorrect reporting by Synchrony Bank.

The website had an offer at the United Airlines reservation page for a United Explorer Mileage Plus Credit Card which offered an incentive for {$250.00} credit card credit and XXXX bonus miles. I went off this site and looked at other options for me. I then came back to the United Website and applied for a United Explorer Mileage Plus credit card. I was approved and the information was sent to me to use the card. I noticed then that the card was a United Explorer Mileage Plus Credit Card with the incentive of XXXX bonus miles. At this time, I called Customer Service ( United Explorer Mileage Plus Credit Card ) to try to get the card changed to the {$250.00} credit card credit and XXXX bonus miles. The representative told me at the time that she could get it fixed but we should wait 7-10 days for United to make the change. On XX/XX/2019, when I received the actual credit card, I saw it was the XXXX mile incentive one. I again called United Explorer Mileage Plus Credit Card Services to see if the change had been made and found out it had not been done yet. We talked to a Representative name XXXX XXXX of XXXX, Missouri who told us she would get the change done and to wait 7-10 days for it to happen.

I called again to United Explorer Mileage Plus Credit Card Services and spoke to XXXX who ensure me that this would be fixed. I was to expect a credit for {$250.00} on my next credit card bill. To my surprise I received a letter from Chase dated XX/XX/2019, that I was not eligible for the {$250.00} credit and that my card program would be for the XXXX   bonus mileage plan. I find the tone of the letter to trust you for your decision is not very customer friendly. Today, I called United Explorer Mileage Plus Credit Card Services ( Chase ) and spoke to a supervisor ( XXXX? ) who stated she could not fix my issue and that I should contact United Airlines. I then went in a chat session with XXXX XXXX and discussed the issue and she said I should contact Chase to resolve the issue.

I spoke to their executive office team member named XXXX, and she only provided me with a few specific examples but stated there are more. XXXX stated I was given permanent credit with no additional documentation required due to the dollar value of the disputed amounts. Moreover, Citibank also paid the merchants on these disputes when the merchant stated he or she believed the charges were valid. Then, Citibank wrote off the amounts. They never followed up with me for additional supporting documentation to support at any time during the dispute process, including after merchants ' claims. \\n\\nI have repeatedly e-mailed billing disputes asking for all documentation including the merchant response on my disputes. I have received very little from Citibank to date.

I called around XXXX and the rep 's name was XXXX . She was insistent that the merchants were not paid on specific transactions and that Citibank would not pay out twice, stating permanent credits were issued in my favor.

The claims were for a lower price on XXXX for the same item and sold as 'Buy it Now ' price which is NOT an auction price. However they refused to honor the lower price citing the lower price is on an auction site. When asked why they dont honor auction sites, they gave reason as the price of the item is a bid price which doesn't guarantee a purchase at that bid price, which I agree 100 % and yes bid price should not be price matched. However XXXX is not an auction site as they also sell items which customers can buy without bidding. This lower price was for the same item, brand new and NOT bid price. Thus this item any one can buy without bidding. On explaining this to Citi price rewind customer service personnel, they agree to this but will not approve. I escalated to their Supervisor - XXXX who would also agree but will not approve giving a silly reason that even though the item is not on bid or not being auctioned, it may go on bid if its not being sold for longer period of time. I dont understand what kind of reason is this. The item can be either on auction or sold at a fixed price. My lower price corresponds to the fixed price and NOT an auction price. I filed XXXX complain and XXXX XXXX an Executive Office from their Presidents Office called me and insisted that XXXX is an auction site and Citi wont honor the price-rewind claim.

By the time this procedure was over, it was too late at night for me to safely return home and I was stuck in an unsafe area, strictly because of the reprersentation by the XXXX VISA agent I could use the card several hours earlier.\", \"This is continued follow-up and documentation re : complaint XXXX. \\nAmerican Express applied a penalty APR of 29.99 % to my Business Blue account. They claim I missed a payment in XX/XX/XXXX and thus it was applied, and they will review in 12 months. First, this is not correct. On XX/XX/XXXX, I made a XX/XX/XXXX payment of {$1500.00}, and on XX/XX/XXXX, I paid the XX/XX/XXXX bill early, making another payment of {$2800.00} on that date : this was an early payment for XXXX. The XX/XX/XXXX payment of {$500.00} was the XX/XX/XXXX payment. I was charged a penalty APR of 29.99 % for over a year because American Express was confused over an early payment. I also want to know what CFPB 's role is in helping with credit card fraud. This is the agency tasked with protecting consumers, and I intend to pursue action with a lawyer. This is how egregious conducting business with credit card companies has become : I have been a customer of theirs since XXXX ( both Business Blue and American Express Platinum ) and *never* missed a payment. In addition, according to Amex, whom is inaccurate in their response, 1 ) they charged the penalty APR of 29.99 % because I was ( according to them but incorrectly ) 6 days late with a payment ( after 20 years of no missed payments - ever ), and 2 ) they can apply the penalty APR of 29.99 % for over 12 months. According to the Credit Act of 2009, the penalty APR of 29.99 % can not be applied until after 60 days of late payment ; and 2 ) the penalty rate must be removed after 6 months. So, on all fronts, American Express is incorrect. What is the role of CFPB in helping consumers with this injustice?\", \"To whom it may concern at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Here is the chronology of my transaction on account number : # # # # # # # # # # # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, CitiBank On Monday XX/XX/XXXX I was visiting my daughter in XXXX XXXX. I was there to help her move there from XXXX to attend XXXX school. I was having her car serviced and I had time to kill so I went into the XXXX XXXX and purchased a XXXX XXXX purse that was reduced to {$14.00} and some odd dollars. I used my XXXX card to get additional savings and I believe that my bill came to approximately {$16.00} and some odd cents with tax. I generally pay my balance off immediately at the register with cash, so that I do not have a balance on my account, but for whatever reason on that day, I decided to pay it later. I never received a bill/statement in the mail, but when I was in downtown XXXX sometime in XX/XX/XXXX, I remembered that I need to pay for the purse that Id purchased in Indiana and I also needed to have my parking validated, so I used that opportunity to go in and pay my bill in person. The cashier pulled up my account by my social security number, gave me the balance that was due on the computer of {$16.00} and odd cents. I paid in cash. I believed at that time, my debt was paid in full and settled. \\n\\nMonths go by and then I started getting a series of calls from XXXX XXXX. I dont have any nearby XXXX 's stores and I thought that it was just another solicitation since they did not leave messages, so I ignored the calls. When I blocked the XXXX 800 number, I received a call from XXXX and they left a message from their credit department. This was on XX/XX/XXXX. I immediately called them back at XXXX and spoke with a credit counselor for 13 minutes. I was shocked when she told me that I had a balance of {$150.00}. I was outraged that somehow a {$14.00} purse that I knew that I had paid for, had somehow grown into such an outrageous charge. I was driving when I spoke with the credit department and was therefore not able to take notes. She told me that when I paid my bill in person, it was paid late and that a {$2.00} charge was added. I was never informed of the additional amount when I paid the bill. That {$2.00} had now grown to {$150.00}. I explained that I had no way of knowing about the {$2.00} change and I would have gladly paid it when I paid the {$16.00}, if I had known about it. I was never informed by the customer service department that a {$2.00} fee had been added. I never received a bill. I was informed that when I moved, and I changed the address on my account, that only changed my account with XXXX, but not with their credit department. How is a consumer suppose to know this? The credit department still had my previous address at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on file. What they didnt know is that I still own that home and I rent it out. My tenant is a close personal friend who always passes along my mail, and I had not received any bills from XXXX during the disputed time period. I was livid about the situation and told the credit personal that I would be canceling my account and never shopping at XXXX again. She reduced one of the late charges and reduced the bill down to approximately {$120.00}. I was disgusted. I decided that I would go into my local XXXX directly and pay the amount in cash and close my account. I was driving so I was not in a position to take notes or conduct further business. \\n\\nI immediately went into the customer service counter at the XXXX XXXX  XXXX  to pay up and be done with the whole situation. My husband thought that I should not pay the amount on principal. He thought that we should have them send us to collections and fight it there. Quite frankly, the amount wasnt worth my time. I just wanted to put the situation behind me, never shop at XXXX again and tell everyone who would listen about this outrageous situation. I was once again prepared to pay the full amount in cash, I was told at the customer service counter that they could not close my account, that they were not authorized to do that. They told me to call the credit department back, that they were the only ones authorized to close my account and that I also might have better luck with a different credit counselor. \\n\\nI immediately went home and called back the credit department. I was now in a position to take notes. I spoke with XXXX, who gave me her ID number : XXXX. She agreed that if I had known that I owned the {$2.00} late fee, that I would have paid it at the time that I paid my bill in person. Common sense dictates that anyone who went to the trouble of paying the bill in person for such a small purchase, would have paid the full amount that was only approximately {$18.00} in total. XXXX said that she was authorized to reduce the charge from the {$120.00} and some odd cents down to {$81.00}. I of course wasnt happy about this con scheme by CitiBank for all of the charges on a {$2.00} late fee but what are you going to do? XXXX confirmed that the previous counselor that I had spoken with at XXXX had not made the billing address change, even though I had requested that it be changed to my current address at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, CA. XXXX could not provide me confirmation in writing that my account had been canceled because they were not set up to do so that her location. She gave me a confirmation of # XXXX and told me that I was now paid up in full. XXXX was sympathetic and told me that their policy was to add another {$2.00} charge to my bill because once again, I was paying late. I told her to add {$5.00} to what I way paying to avoid that. She told me that she could not authorize additional payment from her location. The only way to avoid another {$2.00} late fee was either to put my debit card on file for automatic payment, or to go into a store location and that they could authorize additional payments. There was no way that I way going to give CitiBank free access to my debit card, so I went into the XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and paid {$5.00} so that I could cover any additional late fees. \\n\\nAfter all of that effort on my part, paying a bill that no ethical business would have charged me to begin with, I received a new account statement yesterday in the mail with a {$34.00} late fee. I will NOT be paying this bill. Evidently XXXX/CitiBank now believe that they can bill me in perpetuity for {$2.00} late fee on a {$14.00} purse.\", 'Dispute Update from customer Card ending in XXXX RE : Case Number : XXXX Merchant Name : XXXX XXXX XXXX  Dispute Amount : {$42.00} Attention : Discover Card Account Member Services Discover Card Fraud Department I have spent countless hours describing to Discover card member services the details on this matter. On XX/XX/19, the last two Discover Card representatives ( XXXX @ Discover Card Delaware call center, XXXX @ Discover Card Utah call center ) spent well over an hour documenting my inputs on the matter. I will also share them with you below. I will also be notifying the Ohio State Attorney General, CFPB, and XXXX. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/19, I went into XXXX XXXX in XXXX and had XXXX as their sales representative / service provider for XXXX companies. I attempted to accomplish the following : 1. Terminate my unlimited grandfathered XXXX XXXX phone service. \\n2. Transfer my XXXX neighbor ( XXXX XXXX ) XXXX XXXX home phone account I had as a sub account under my former address to his own account. You can see this in the pdf file that XXXX provided. \\n3. Activate my XXXX XXXX Phone/Device as a month to month phone plan with a seperate XXXX Month to Month account ( totally separate company from parent XXXX XXXX ).  NOTE, that # 1, # 2 and # 3 above ALL conflicted. \\n\\nXXXX XXXX and their lack of ability to manage accounts as a 3rd party provider of XXXX services caused the following problems : 1. The new phone WOULD NOT function! The only functions it had were to dial *XXXX. Doing so went to XXXX XXXX, who has nothing to do with their sister office that provides month to month service. Like 2 different companies. The telephone number would not even work, as ONLY XXXX is all the phone would dial. \\n\\n2. XXXX compromised my social secirity number. I spent two weeks straightening this out. They had my information and XXXX XXXX completely mixed up! Furthermore, they would not allow me to resolve because they had his social security number on MY account. I STILL AM RECEIVING EMAIL BILLS ADDRESSED TO XXXX. I may have to file a police report on this. Fortunately, a XXXX rep fixed this just prior to XXXX for me, and sent me a confirmation email on the matter. \\n\\n3. I had 2 XXXX managers hang up on XXXX and I, and I honestly lost track of every time ( 5+ ) I thought I was finally talking to the right manager/supervisor, only to be told I had to call the other office. \\n\\n4. I called XXXX XXXX and was told that I had a better chance of dealing directly with XXXX than they did. They apparently have 1 rep and usually takes at least one day for him or her to get back to them, per XXXX. \\n\\nBottomm line, this was not only less than one month worth of service for a partial refund, or me saying or complaining of bad service, this was a non working phone, NO SERVICE except for XXXX and to make matters final, while trying to work this out with XXXX , they terminated my service completely, cutting me off in mid conversation. \\n\\nI insist that Discover Card come up with a plan to protect their customers. When I authorize a charge, and find it to be fradulent, defective, whether a partial or full refund, I expect it to be honored, without question. In this case I clearly had ZERO functional service. \\n\\nAs a retired military member that has served around the globe for over 26 years, I am frustrated at companies that find it easier to steal from customers rather than provide support. In this case, I find Discover Card more at fault than XXXX XXXX, XXXX Month to Month and XXXX XXXX. \\n\\nPlease ensure Discover Card does their duty to refund the money I paid for NO service. If there are future problems, let customers settle matters in the courts. Do not compromise my account, or use my funds where I clearly specify you have NO permission to do.

I took the transfer and paid every month until it was paid off. In the final month of the promotional period, I made the last payment two days before the promotional period expired. However, that same month, I made some purchases using the same credit card. I came to find out that Bank of America charged me interest on the new purchases immediately, without the customary grace period of 30-days, and applied only a small portion of my aforementioned payment ( to pay off the balance transfer ) towards the promotional amount and the rest was applied towards the new purchases. By doing this, Bank of America charged me interest on the new charges ( even though they were not even due ) and on the initial promotional transfer that I thought was being paid off based on the billing statement due. In looking at the banks statement, a person would not know that the payment made to pay off the entire balance, would, in fact, pay a small portion of the promotional balance ( triggering an interest charge ) and accruing additional interest charges on new purchase immediately upon such charges being posted. It is completely misleading. \\n\\nAlthough my charges were minimal, I feel that this is a fraudulent scheme by the Bank and wanted to bring it to the attention of the authorities. On a large scale, this scheme generates the bank income by hiding their policy regarding promotional balance transfers and new purchases and the way they charge interest and apply payments.', 'I filed a claims with XXXX XXXX and CITI XXXX to resolve a Disputete regarding a seller who made a claim for payment through XXXX XXXX  for services or products that were not provided.

I enrolled in the offer and made the required purchases. \\n\\nI have never received the XXXX bonus points. I submitted an email through the bank 's online banking service to customer service. A representative replied that she could not help with reward points, that I needed to call a separate department. I replied that this was insane, and that customer service should be able to provide Customer Service. The representative again replied that I needed to call another department. \\n\\nI called the number provided. Guess what? The rewards department stated that they could not assist with this issue and they would forward it to another department.

It was not what I needed or expected so I asked for a refund and it was not given. I then filed a dispute through papal. The antivirus company emailed me stating that if I cancel the dispute they would refund the monies. I did as instructed and I am still being given the runaround by this company and they have not refunded the monies. I contacted Paypal explaining and they stated too sad, too bad attitude. They stated because I cancel the dispute I am out of the money. This third world antivirus company should not be able to mislead the consumer in believing they will receive a credit and they do not follow through.

I communicated the below details on multiple occasions, and I do not understand how this could be a valid charge, given that I am explaining it was essentially taken from me by the threat of force. Even more bizarre is that my credit card transaction history indicates the charge was for industrial chemicals. I clearly did not buy industrial chemicals on a three day tourism trip. If in fact this was a charge for industrial chemicals it would be a fraudulent charge, because I never purchased industrial chemicals and if it is a charge from that bar, it is still fraud, because it was a bar, not a chemicals seller, and the card was taken from me by force. \\n\\nThis is my explanation of the disputed charge of {$1800.00} for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I flew from XXXX XXXX, to XXXX leaving XX/XX/2019, and arrived XX/XX/2019 in the evening. Upon checking in I went to locate a restaurant. While walking from the XXXX XXXX in XXXX to locate a restaurant a man stopped me and said something in XXXX. When I indicated that I did not speak XXXX he asked me in English for a lighter. I said I did not have one, but said to him I was trying to locate a restaurant that was not full of tourists, he described one, but I did not understand the location. He said he was visiting from XXXX, XXXX with his wife and kids, but they were back at the hotel and he was going for a walk, so he would just show me where it is. Once we arrived at the restaurant a block or so away near XXXX XXXX, he said he would sit down and eat as well. At the conclusion he paid for the bill, before I knew that the bill had come, and said he was doing so because he was enjoying my company. In return he asked that I have a drink with him. I told him I had just flown in, and had only slept 20 minutes in over 24 hours. He urged that I just have one drink, and I unfortunately agreed. \\n\\nHe told me his friend had recommended a particular bar he wanted to see. I agreed, and it turned-out it was in a basement level of a nice building. Upon walking in we were seated, and I thought he was ordering us each one drink. Instead they started bringing food, and several bottles of alcohol. I objected to the waiter bring the food and drink, and said we had not ordered it. The gentlemen with me said he had done so when we were sitting down. \\n\\nWithin a few minutes two women came and sat down at our table. I realized that she was probably a prostitute. I informed her that I was XXXX and had a boyfriend in XXXX XXXX, and showed her pictures of him. I thought my efforts had paid off, when she got up and left. I tried to get-up but the gentlemen seated next to me, kept me from leaving saying to wait so he could finish his drink. Before that could happen she returned. She appeared to have been sent back. She told me that she had to dance with me. I agreed to dance with her, hoping that would allow me to get rid of her, and possibly get away from the situation. I tried to leave shortly after. Upon saying I was leaving, three men came to our table, so that I had four men preventing me from leaving. \\n\\nI was then handed a bill for about {$4100.00}. I protested that it was not possible that 11 bottles of champagne were delivered, or consumed, and that I had not ordered anything. They then told me they would charge me for half, and charge the other guy who had brought me there for half. I told them I had not ordered anything, and had drank about two glasses, I had been offered by the guy who brought me. They told me I would not be allowed to leave without paying. They asked me to hand them my wallet. I refused. They asked how much cash I had in the wallet, I told them I was on the first day of my trip and could not give them all my cash. I told them I had to use a credit card. They asked me to use a card with the pin I told them I had withdrawn the maximum, and it would be rejected and that I had to use a credit card. \\n\\nThey told me they would not let me leave unless I gave them some cash. They demanded at least {$100.00}. I had no choice, given the number of men there, so I paid them {$100.00} cash for having drank two drinks, though I had not ordered anything. They also demanded that I show them my driver \\'s license, so I did. When they ran the credit card for {$1800.00} they told me to sign. Since they had my driver \\'s license and card, and knew my name, I could not write another name. So I printed my name, and did not sign. The man I was there with was getting paid cash when I left the bar. He tried to take me back to the hotel and I refused. I took a taxi back to the hotel I did not sign the receipt. To show I was being forced to do it I printed my name. I never print my name when there is a legitimate charge. \\n\\nImmediately after getting back to the hotel, I went to the front desk and they called the police. I had my hotel room number memorized, despite having just checked-in, and I believe that was part of the reason why the hotel staff was so supportive. The hotel told me that the police needed to send a \"\" Tourism Police Unit \\'\\' because they were the only ones that spoke English, and they did not have officers that could come to the hotel that night. I went up to the hotel room and immediately called and opened the dispute, explaining the above to the person on the phone. \\n\\nI was able to leave after giving them {$100.00} cash and the credit card, I did not do so voluntarily, but did that because of the number of men there requiring that I do that. When they told me I had to sign, I printed my name to show to the credit card that I was being forced to do it.\"\\nReceived a denial letter from Bank of America- Alaska Airlines Credit card, for a credit card that I never applied for. Letter was dated XX/XX/2019.\\n\"I have been a loyal Citibank customer since XX/XX/XXXX. I have made every credit payment on time, until recently ( Summer of XX/XX/XXXX ). Unfortunately I was placed on medical leave due to some treatments I am receiving and as a result I am not allowed to work temporarily. As a result of my leave from work and delay in getting my temporary leave benefits, I did fall behind on one payment to Citibank. Actually, I did log on to Citibank to make that payment and was expected to pay 3 times the normal payment amount, therefore I was unable to make that payment at that time, resulting in some fees and interest charges putting me over my limit. \\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I did speak to an Agent whose job was something along the lines of Customer Solutions ( I apologize that I do not have the proper title, but the call was on XX/XX/XXXX. ) I entered into an agreement with this agent that I would pay {$130.00} a month until the account was caught up ( take note that this is still more than my average minimum payments by at least double ) but I wanted to get caught up and back on track not only to protect my credit, but also to keep my card in good standing for the future. I was assured by this agent that entering into this agreement would protect my card and keep it open as long as I made the minimum monthly payment, via bank draft. On XX/XX/XXXX, Citibank took {$130.00} out of my checking account as agreed upon. On the same date Citibank closed my account. When I became aware of this ( a week later XX/XX/XXXX ) I did call and speak to an agent who stated that the bank closed it, and that no reason is listed. I escalated the issue and indicated that the account should have been protected against closure, as I had entered into an agreement with Citibank- an Accounts Manager did tell me that my account should have been protected from closure with this agreement as she could see where the payment was made as agreed upon. I have upheld my end of the agreement & I feel disappointed that Citibank would close my account anyway, despite my good faith efforts. Prior to this, I have never missed any payments on any of my accounts on my credit, so there would be no other reason to do that. Even the paperwork sent states that the account will become current if I keep the agreement, however it can not become \"\" current \\'\\' if it is closed. We made an agreement and Citibank has broken their end of the bargain by closing my account.', 'On multiple occasions I have been preapproved for a new account by American Express.

American Express refused to reaffirm and charged off the balance. \\n\\nI have called multiple times to find out when I will be removed from there black list, or be able to become a card holder again as I have seen on many credit foreums that they have been getting more lenient with people who have had past bankruptcy discharge that included American Express.

I called chase and was told that The XXXX XXXX has submitted printouts from a website I have never seen stating what their cancellation charges would be.

Another payment was scheduled in error in the amount of {$270.00} on XX/XX/XXXX which was again returned by my bank and I was charged another {$39.00} return check fee by Citi Bank on XX/XX/XXXX. My credit limit on this card was {$300.00}. I made a payment of {$280.00} to make up for the payments that were returned on XX/XX/XXXX which cleared my bank on XX/XX/XXXX. I was charged another return check fee of {$39.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. I called Citi Bank to let them know I had fraud on my account and found out that they had the payment of {$280.00} on hold until XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke with a Citi Bank representative who called my bank to verify that the funds did clear which they confirmed it did and my payment was taken off hold. This left me with a credit to my balance of {$110.00} and the full credit limit of {$300.00} available to use. I made a cash advance of {$100.00} on XX/XX/XXXX which ended up leaving me with an available credit of {$260.00} due to the credit on my balance and a credit on my balance in the amount of XXXX. I went to use my card yesterday on XX/XX/XXXX for {$30.00} and the card was declined. I called CitiBank and was on the phone for over 30 minutes when they said that they closed my account due to the 2 payments that were returned unpaid. They said they would be able to issue a check for {$62.00} since that was the credit on my balance but that I would have to wait 1-2 billing cycles for my initial deposit of {$300.00} to be returned. I asked for a manager and XXXX the representative who I was speaking to said no one was available and they would have to call me back in about 10 minutes. After over 4 hours no one called me back so I called them again. I explained the situation to the manager XXXX and she said since the account was now closed she would not be able to issue a check for the initial deposit for 1-2 billing cycles but could issue the check for {$62.00} immediately. So after all was said and done my current balance was - {$62.00} and they owed me {$300.00}. I looked at the account today XX/XX/XXXX and now it is showing that there is a current balance of {$210.00} but there were no purchases and no transactions posted between the 2 days. They are trying to say that I owe a balance now so they can try to swindle me out of my money. I took screenshots of everything. They are trying to scam me and are using unfair and unlawful practices.\\nIn XXXX of 2019 I received 2 warrants in debt from Bank of America one stating that I owe them {$3500.00} on one credit card and another stating that I owe them {$3400.00} on another credit card. I filed an Identity Theft Report with the FTC and contacted Bank of America. After speaking with 5 different people at Bank of America they stated that they will investigate and I have heard nothing back. I contacted their attorneys and showed up for the first court date. I sent all documentation to Bank of America asking them to show proof that I opened these accounts and have not received anything back from them after 30 days. I sent the report to all credit reporting agencies and they have blocked it off my credit report.\\nI was using the American Express Blueburd card. On XX/XX/2019, at XXXX XXXX, I got my daily balance stating I had a negative dollar balance, which I didn\\'t realize was possible since the last place the card was used was at XXXX, where I swiped the card, and the remaining balance was removed, and I paid cash for what was left. XX/XX/2019, I received an email staring that my account had been frozen, because they reviewed my account and believe that I violated the terms and conditions, a refund check would be sent out, and if I had any further questions, I could write a letter and send it to a po box in GA. On XX/XX/2019 a refund had been issued to my account bringing my balance to {$100.00}. Every day at XXXX, I still get a balance text telling me this XXXX is in my account.

The first two installment payments were processed correctly. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/2018, I was approved and awarded an Amazon Rewards Visa, issued by Chase Bank. The terms and conditions of this card include Amazon adding this card to my Amazon account, and making it the default purchase option for future purchases. \\n\\nThe 3rd installment payment was charged to this new Amazon Rewards Visa card, unbeknownst to me. In my attempts to resolve this issue directly with Amazon, several representatives have suggested that this occurred because the XXXX XXXX card ending in XXXX was declined, but there is no evidence of this from Amazon or XXXX XXXX. Instead, I have had a few Amazon customer service representatives confirm there is no attempt in their transaction history showing any attempt to charge the XXXX XXXX card, nor any signs of a declined transaction with XXXX XXXX. \\n\\nThere was no notification provided of this charge to the card from Amazon or Chase. I only realized the error when I received written notification by US Mail that I was delinquent on the Chase account. I had never even logged into or created an account to manage the Amazon Rewards Visa/Chase card since I hadn\\'t knowingly charged any purchase to this card.\\n\\nI have worked with Amazon and Chase over the last year to resolve this issue to no avail. Amazon has provided a gift card to compensate for the problems, but it has not resolved the excessive late fees and interest charges that Chase Bank is attempting to collect. Chase Bank has also reported me as delinquent to the credit bureaus and reduced my credit score from a high of XXXX  to as low as XXXX  in the past year. \\n\\n( Upon receiving the gift card from Amazon in XX/XX/2018, I did make a payment to Chase Bank in the amount that had been charged to them from Amazon, in the amount of {$140.00}. Chase Bank does not dispute this. ) When this problem first came to my attention, I worked with Amazon, who were unwilling to fix any issues, continuing to claim there was nothing they could do and it was a result of my declined card. On hearing this explanation, I attempted to work with Chase Bank to dispute the charges. Chase Bank refused to allow this as a disputed charge with the explanation  that I had received merchandise in exchange for the charges, thus, there is nothing to dispute. They continue to reply with this explanation even today. \\n\\nI was told today by Chase Bank that the best thing I could have done in retrospect was to make the monthly minimum payments on their credit card. I did not make any payments, since I had never authorized or initiated the charges, and I felt I did not owe them any money. \\nThis ultimately is Amazon \\'s issue to resolve, as they are the card issuer and the terms and conditions are through Amazon and the issue was created by Amazon \\'s payment software. Again, however, they are refusing to resolve the issue, and I have been stuck between these two corporations since.', 'I disputed the account in the amount of {$1300.00} that I do not owe and I received a tuped copy and not a bill.

Assignment clause 2. Signed contract with social 3.

Warranty coverage advertised at two ( 2 ) years from Costco plus an additional two ( 2 ) years from Citi for a total of four ( 4 ) years of warranty coverage. Citi requested five ( 5 ) documents to process the claim : ( 1 ) Itemized Store Receipt ( 2 ) Copy of Manufacturers Warranty ( 3 ) Repair Estimate ( 4 ) Photos of Item ( 5 ) Copy of Extended Service Plan All documents were provided. After several weeks, Citi requested an additional repair estimate, which was also provided. Several weeks later, well over a month from the initial claim, Citi further requested : ( 1 ) Please provide the billing statement showing the purchase of the item As this is a claim for an item purchases 3 years ago, Citi does keep those records readily available and must be requested separately. Thus, I would need to request the statements from Citi to provide back to Citi to process the warranty coverage, all for an item which is covered by the advertised warranty. It is also important to note that this most recent requested item was not requested from Citi initially over a month ago and should not be the consumer \\'s burden to provide as this is all data that is owned and accessible by Citi. The obstacles Citi has put in place are excessively burdensome to successfully process an extended warranty claim and does not align with their advertised extended warranty coverage.\"\\nI applied/opened account in XX/XX/2019 with American Express.

I met the spending criteria, and American Express is stating there is nothing on my account saying I get the promotion. I would have never applied for the card had the promotional offer not been offered. I feel a bait and switch was done, and I kept my end of the agreement, and American Express is conveniently not awarding agreed upon points.\\nThese are not my Accounts.\\nI use to have a Cabela \\'s Visa credit card in which I set up a annual recurring charge with XXXX for XXXX XXXX. Cabela \\'s was sold to XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX decided to use Capital One as their Visa card company. When my Cabela \\'s card expired, Capital One sent me a Visa card in the mail. I called Capital One and told them I did not want their card and that I was going to destroy the card which I did. Later I kept getting emails from XXXX stating that my XXXX XXXX subscription was expiring. I then paid the subscription using XXXX and another credit card in XXXX. In XXXX I receive a credit card statement from Capital One showing a balance of {$99.00} on a card that I did not have. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Capital One and ask how XXXX could charge me on a card that I never activated and they stated that if a merchant contacts XXXX, that XXXX will give them the card number. I told them that in my opinion it was fraud since I never activated or have used the card. They told me to contact XXXX customer support to see if XXXX would issue me a credit for {$99.00}. In called XXXX and explained my situation and they told me to contact Capital One and have Capital One start a fraud investigation. They also gave me a reference # XXXX to give to Capital One. I called Capital One and they said that they would start a fraud investigation which would take about 10 days to completed. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Capital One \\'s fraud department to check on the status of my fraud investigation. The rep I spoke to told me that Capital One had not issued a fraud alert on the {$99.00}. He then stated that he would issue one himself and I should hear something in 10 days. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from Capital One stated that my fraud complaint has been resolved. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received another letter from Capital One stating that they have found no evidence of fraud and that my account would be adjusted. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a credit card statement from Capital One showing the {$99.00} charge. I called Capital One on XX/XX/XXXX to see why I was being charged for something I did not authorize. Their fraud department told me that I was responsible for the charge which I disagreed and ask to speak to their manager. Their manager XXXX tried to explain to me that it was my fault and I needed to pay the {$99.00}. After a few minutes of arguing with her she finally said she would initate a three way call between myself, XXXX and herself. By coincedence, the XXXX rep was the same one I had talked to on XX/XX/XXXX. I went on to state my case and he agreed that I had paid the subscription on XX/XX/XXXX using XXXX.

Each time I called, and continue to call for an update, it seems that each representative had a different piece of information. Most try to end the call quickly, providing an incredible lack of customer service, by saying there was no information showing on their side which was false and proven by more aware representatives - giving me consistent anxiety as I made endless due diligence in following up with this matter. Bank of America made a disappointing breach to their {$0.00} Fraud Liability Guarantee even after confirming that I received no security notification from them of the transactions that posted onto my account.

To this date, I still have not been rightfully credited by Bank of America for the fraudulent transactions even after consistent due diligence and daily follow ups with relevant documentations pertaining my fraud claim.\\n\"I had two balance transfer transactions on the same card. Both with unique transaction IDs and expiration dates. I was approaching the expiration on the first one and inquired through the customer service number how I would go about making a payment to pay that particular balance off. I was informed that I would have to wait until the day that offer expired to make the payment being as that balance would then be assigned an APR ( where all previous balances were at zero APR ). I called the card company again when that day came and asked if that was indeed correct. They said that I should submit the payment and they would apply my minimum payment according to their terms and everything paid beyond that would be applied to the balance with the highest APR. Seeing as that balance was expiring that day the customer service rep said I was good to go forward with paying that balance off. I made the payment moments later through their online app and didnt think anything more about it. I received my new statement and found that not only was my payment not applied to that balance, but they also extended that particular transfer offer another month. Only about a tenth of the almost {$1000.00} dollar payment was applied to the expiring balance and the rest was applied to the other balance transfer that didnt expire for months. I opened a case that day with the customer service department who was supposed to return my call with any updates or results since they didnt understand why the offer was extended another month and not sure it can be fix now that the payment has been applied. \\nA week went by with no phone calls. I called back and was told there was no open case and was transferred to the executive office who proceeded to open a case and send me to a supervisor. That was over a month ago. I have called roughly once a week to check up seeing as no one ever called me back as they claimed they would. I have spoken to countless supervisors and case managers who continue to say weve never seen anything like that and I dont know how that happened or how we can fix it. I even opened a resolution case with the bank that the card is issued by and that case was closed 20 minutes later because a case with the executive office is already open and they will take care of the issue. I just received my newest statement which now has interest included for that remaining ( now expired ) balance transfer that should have been paid off two months ago. I should probably mention that I also work for this same bank and even being both an employee and a customer has gotten me no closer to the issue being resolved.\"\\nOld navy credit card has received payments and have not posted them on time.

By XX/XX/XXXX, my secured card was closed and my e statements were restricted shortly after that. In XX/XX/XXXX, on numerous occasions I called in to inquire about my Citi bank credit card. The debt is listed on my credit report as failed to pay. Citi bank has horrible customer service representatives that are not thorough when review information or providing the facts that I requested. I paid a security deposit to my account so when my account was closed the amount owed was XXXX. I was charged fees that were not valid and Citi has refused to address my concerns for the past year. In XX/XX/XXXX, I formally filed a dispute via mail and receive a generic response stating that Citi was favored in the dispute process which is overtly biased based on their internal team review the account. I never got information that I requested about contacting the credit management department or any other department beside their recovery team who have been little to no help. Their ways of handling consumers and their monies are erroneous. It\\'s a power struggle working with a big company that has created a maze of tunnels so that consumers are frustrated befor their concerns are met with solutions. In summary, I do not owe any amount over the balance after my account was credited. I would like to have a manager from the credit department contact me about this matter. Also, I would like to be provided a letter with the date of closure and reason why the account was closed in the first place.\\n\"On XX/XX/2019 my credit card was charged {$99.00} for an annual subscription of XXXX XXXX XXXX magazine. This was an unauthorized charge and I attempted to call the XXXX but was directed to a website where I entered in my desire to cancel. I got no result. I performed this action again and received the same non result, nor any correspondence. \\nMeantime, I sent an email to Barclays as soon as I received my statement with the charge. They were barely helpful, repeating the 800 #, and asking me to call their dispute department. The problem is each time I called, it took 30 minutes or more to explain the issue and at the last attempt, the representative actually laid the phone on the desk, and I had to start the process again! \\nI have tried to enlist Barclay \\'s help with the disputed charge, via email and voice calls, but, given the time elapsed, I have now seen my credit score lowered by 50 points as the account has been declared delinquent. \\nThat is unfair and detrimental to the well being of myself and my family and might have an impact on my ability to find work in the future.', 'On or about XX/XX/2019, I changed my AutoPay settings online from payment in full to minimum payment only. Section 1 ( f ) of the terms and conditions ( attached hereto ) indicate that such changes are acceptable if made at least three business days before the payment date, which was  XX/XX/2019. \\n\\nUpon making such change, the next screen on the FNB website is substantially in the form attached hereto, which indicates explicitly that such \"\" changes will take effect on the current billing cycle. \\'\\' On  or about XX/XX/2019, FNB Omaha attempted to make an unauthorized withdrawal of {$3900.00}. This was unauthorized because my instructions to FNB, and accepted by FNB, only authorized the minimum payment only to be deducted. I was then charged a {$29.00} NSF fee by my home bank due to this unauthorized withdrawal by FNB ( shown in the transaction attached hereto ). \\n\\nOn XXXX XXXX  and XX/XX/2019, I reached out to FNB Omaha to notify them of the situation. I spoke to supervisor XXXX at or about XXXX on XX/XX/2019, who advised me of FNB \\'s deceptive practice of ignoring AutoPay changes for the current billing cycle. I told him about the Terms and Conditions to the contrary, as well as the explicit notification on the website that \"\" changes will take effect on the current billing cycle, \\'\\' and XXXX confirmed that FNB \\'s practice was in fact the practice routinely used and what he advises to all of FNB \\'s other customers.\"\\nI had a Synchrony Bank/Walmart Credit Credit opened XX/XX/XXXX and closed around XXXX I believe. At the time of closing this account there was a major problem, my issue was this account was paid in full at the location in XXXX, Maryland. The payment that I made didn\\'t post to my account until 3 days later. When I call the Customer Service my payment disappeared Walmart Customers Service said there were having system problems. My credit card account end up going to collection. I recently received a check from Synchrony Bank/ Walmart saying that they issuing me a check for overpayment.\\n\"I receive an offer to increase my credit limit and called in, instead of doing online. The person took my income information and asked other questions and stated I would hear back if they had any thing. I explained the letter read it would be instant, he stated he would need my social security number to do that, I asked if this was a credit pull and declined after he told me that is the only way to get instant determination. I called back weeks later and spoke with a manager and she stated the person never submitted the information and it was a time sensitive matter and she would escalated it, to possibly reopen the file. \\n\\nXXXX XXXX from Texas office called me on XX/XX/2019 to inform me he listens to the call and the representative did everything correct. I told him that was bull XXXX, and I was going to file a complaint. \\n\\nMy wife receive the same letter and went online and received instant increase. I think Chase was misleading and just collected information from me.\"\\nI was shocked when reviewing my credit report and found late payments on the dates below : XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX I am not sure how this happened. I believe I made my payments to you when I received my statements. My only thought is that my statement did not get to me.\\n\"In XXXX I made a purchase with XXXX XXXX and my Chase card was charged {$810.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. As of XXXX I had still not received the product. I contacted XXXX XXXX  at the beginning of XXXX to make them aware I still had not received the product. A guy at the company who signs his communication as `` XXXX \\'\\' said he was going to send the product and provided a tracking number. The tracking number at that time said \"\" package ready for pick up \\'\\' however it was never out for delivery. I tried to contact this company from my number however it would ring 1 time then go to voicemail. I called from another number and the company answered which indicated they had blocked my number from being able to contact them. The guy claimed he shipped it but then when I checked the tracking number again nothing was shipped. A few days later I contacted the company again and told them I was disputing through my bank and the gentlemen said he was going to cancel my order and refund me the money. I immediately contacted Chase to file a dispute since this company could not provide me a straight answer. At this point I knew something was not right and was nervous about fraud. Chase issued me a temporary credit and said they would be back in contact. XXXX XXXX sent me an email on XX/XX/XXXX with a invoice attached stating my transaction had been refunded back to my Chase card. On XX/XX/XXXX Chase sent me a letter stating \"\" the disputed charges were valid \\'\\'. I called Chase when I got this letter in the mail on XX/XX/XXXX. They made me aware XXXX XXXX said the package was sent to me. I explained all of the above and made Chase aware this company was lying. I then asked for the tracking number that XXXX XXXX provided Chase and the lady at Chase gave me the tracking number. This tracking number was linked to a package that was sent to XXXX, ID. and I reside in XXXX, Va. The package was signed for by someone with a name \"\" XXXX \\'\\' which is not my name nor anybody at my residence. I explained this to Chase and they refused to reopen my claim or look into this further. I made them aware I was contacting the CFPB to file a formal complaint due to their complete lack of customer advocacy and knowledge of how to investigate a dispute. Chase said I could write into their company to discuss further which I do not feel like I should have to do. I provided them all information on the charges and even have e-mails from this company stating the order was canceled and refunded however Chase will still not dispute or handle the issue. Also, I stopped replying to XXXX after filing my dispute. XXXX XXXX  started sending me bogus emails claiming they tried to contact me ( they didn\\'t ), said they shipped it to me ( they canceled the package and sent to a \"\" different \\'\\' customer, claimed they refunded my amount in full ( Chase confirmed they did not ). UPS confirms no package was delivered to me from XXXX XXXX, UPS websites confirms the tracking number was changed and a package went else where, emails confirm that a refund should have been issued however Chase still refuses to issue a credit or do anything on my behalf to help me recover these funds. Working with XXXX XXXX is not an option at this point as they lie, provide inaccurate information and promise a refund has been made already which Chase confirms it has not. This is blatant fraud and nobody should have to invest this much time as a CUSTOMER to recover funds through a credit card company who PROMISES to always support/take care of their customers.\"\\nI have 3 unknown inquiries on my credit report. Amex on XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/2019, and XXXX  on XX/XX/2019. I just saw this on my credit score and it is greatly affecting my score.\\nI inadvertently submitted a {$150.00} payment on XX/XX/2019 through my bank \\'s online bill pay service ( XXXX XXXX ) to a credit card that I previously closed. XXXX changed providers ( from Bank of America to XXXX and I had left this payee in my bill pay ). I have contacted XXXX, XXXX XXXX multiple times. The real obstacle is Bank of America ; they are unwilling to accept the basic data including the credit trace # XXXX XXXX XXXX and the check file # XXXX. The account is no longer active ( last four digits XXXX and it no longer appears in their system ), but they should have records of bank transfers according to routing numbers. I have proof of payment from the bank ( attached ) ; the funds were paid by my bank using the Check Free Bill Pay system ( the bank says this is important because the funds were not wired to BOA from my ckg acct directly but the bank \\'s Ck Pay System ). A XXXX XXXX representative ( XXXX XXXX ) on two separate occasions attempted to reconcile this problem ( XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/2019 ). On XX/XX/XXXX we called Bank of America ( BOA ) together and spent 1 hour and 29 mins on the phone until the manager, XXXX, in BOA credit card servicing disconnected the call ( we were stunned ). Before that we had spoken to XXXX XXXX in BOA \\'s Recovery Services, XXXX ( Deposit servicing ), XXXX and XXXX, Supervisor, ( both in credit card servicing ). The attachment shows the payment to BOA but they will not return this money and refuse to discuss possible solutions. If indeed the account has been closed, why hasn\\'t the payment been returned to my checking account?\\nThis credit card was sent to me without me applying for it while I was unemployed. Now I am unemployed again and not receiving unemployment so I dont believe I should have to pay for it since it was illegally taken out.\\nCan not get Log into account in order to set up payments or any other accounts from Synchrony credit services or any account serviced via Synchrony! I have talked to them was supposed to try it in a week and if not call back, which I did and called back. Was given another excuse and another week to correct?????? this issue. Strange my wife \\'s accounts seem to work, NONE of mine, you figure it out. Anyway I called them today and asked them to send me paper statement since it is obvious that they can not get all their parts in one basket .... I have also informed them that they are the worst and this was not the FIRST time I\\'ve had issues with them. I\\'M SORRY, is what I get .... had I not called them again and asked for a paper statement from here on and the payment would have been late or not made cause I was NOT ABLE to log in, they would have turned me in the the credit reporting agency as a missed payment ... .. FAIR huh????\\n\"On XX/XX/XXXX, I obtained a cash advance in the amount of {$5700.00} on my credit card with Bank of America due to repairs required on my house. On the next statement I received ( XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX ) it reflected interest of {$36.00} for the advance. The statement of XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX reflected interest of {$120.00} with a \"\" balance subject to interest rate \\'\\' of {$6000.00}. The statement of XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX reflected interest of {$120.00} with a \"\" balance subject to interest rate \\'\\' of XXXX. My most recent statement ( XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX ) reflects interest of {$160.00} with a \"\" balance subject to interest rate \\'\\' of {$7200.00}. \\n\\nI asked a customer service representative today why the cash advance balance is higher than the original advance, and was informed when payments are received the minimum payment amount goes to the lowest APR balances first and anything above that to the higher APR balances. This information is on their monthly statement. I also asked if the monthly interest on the cash advance balance is calculated on the \"\" higher \\'\\' balance of principal plus unpaid interest, and was told yes. I understand this as capitalized interest ( charging interest on interest ) and thought it was illegal.', 'I am requesting in writing on Capital One letterhead once the Capital One/Neiman Marcus account is paid off, this will be removed from my credit report. This is a charged off account which means it MUST remain on my report for 7 years weather I pay it or not and it doesn\\'t remove the account from my credit report. Clearing up the past due balance doesn\\'t erase the fact that my account was actually charged-off despite me contacting Capital One/Neiman Marcus notifying you when I was laid off from work without notice. \\n\\nI was trying to show good faith as this is my responbility, but I was late on my XX/XX/2019 payment due to XXXX and a week did not even past before Capital One reported to the credit bureau I was late. Capital One could have reached out to me and I could have explained I planned to make my payment on XX/XX/2019 which was my next paycheck, but since the good faith is not being returned, I want in writing that once this is paid off, Capital One or Neiman Marcus will remove this from my credit report. \\n\\nNot to mention, they see it is a struggling account and Im trying to catch up on payments and even when payments are made ( attached copy of payments from my account ), they are still adding on late fees making it IMPOSSIBLE to catch up ( attached breakdown of some of the late fees accumulated from this year alone ). If I can not get in writing this will be removed upon me finishing payments, you will no longer receive payments after XX/XX/19.\"\\nI had an perfect account with Discover meaning all payments was made on time and usually a payment ahead of time. I had the card since XX/XX/XXXXhad a credit balance of XXXX and only used about XXXX XXXX on the card. in XX/XX/XXXXthey sent a letter saying I can get a consolidation loan to pay off any high interest credit cards. I applied for XXXX XXXX and was told to send proof of income which I am retired so I sent all income I receive from social security also including any other income that\\'s not taxable and I got instant approved and I had 3 cards that was paid off. The very next week I get a call from discover telling me not to use my credit card because they have been frozen and that I need to complete a tax form from the IRS for the past 2 years. I told the representative I been disable since XX/XX/XXXX and won\\'t have filed taxes since XX/XX/XXXX. I also shared with the rep that I had sent in forms from social security as well as a bank statements which I think is personal.and I shared too much personal information already. I went online and signed the tax form to the IRS. I get an email a week or so after asking me to call them and I called them on XX/XX/XXXX and was told my account will be closed because they are unable to verify my address through the IRS because I haven\\'t file taxes in the past 2 years. I told the rep I told them that before and im sure most people that receive social security don\\'t file taxes but we pay our bills. The rep response was that is how they verify addresses. I told her then that\\'s discrimination on anyone that\\'s disable or retired no matter how high the credit score is or how they are able to pay. The company discover will close out their account because they don\\'t file taxes!\\nBack in XX/XX/XXXX I contacted the credit card company and asked what options were available to me. I have had this account for 8 years and have never paid late. I explained that my husband and I are going through financial hardship. I asked if there was any way that I can lower my monthly payment per month because I wanted to keep the card and not hurt my credit score. They explained that the two options available were to settle the account with lump sum payments or apply for a payment plan which would mean closing my account and make reduced payments. I had explained once again that I wanted to keep the card open and was able to make the larger payments but with my husband not working it would become more difficult. I also questioned if they had the option to reduce the interest rate given that I was a good long time customer. They stated no, they no longer do that. I hung up and thought about it and called back a week or two later and requested to be put through to the department that handles seeing if I would qualify for a reduction in payments. After going through the information I was denied. I explained once again I would have no problem making payments as low as $ XXXX {$150.00} per month but the best they could do is refer me to a credit counseling service ( see attached letter dated XX/XX/XXXX ). I had gone online and found that I could reapply which I did and again was denied. I continued to make two more payments but then called them once again asking if there were any other options. I explained that it is ridiculous that they would not accept a lower payment per month and I was told they could split the payment. I then made the request to close the account because of their inability to work with me. In the meantime I have contacted a few other of my credit card companies and they are working with me so clearly this is just the policy of with Chase. I am extremely disappointed that this was unable to be resolved without damaging my credit further.\\nOn XX/XX/XXXXOn XX/XX/XXXX, I went to my nearby Bank of America ATM ( ATM ID : XXXX, Serial number : XXXX ) to make a cash payment for my credit card. I put my credit card and chose Make a Payment option and then I chose Cash payment. Atm asked me to put can, and I put the cash of amount {$660.00} into the atm machine and it starts counting. And as soon as counting finished the ATM shows me transaction cancelled and gave only around {$170.00} cash in return. After that no receipt from the atm was provided to me and I can not see any reported transation into my account statement. I was missing approx. {$480.00} which atm machine ate. I contacted bank of America on that same date of XXXX XX/XX/2021 and when I complained about it, bank s agent told me to wait for 10 days for this issue to be resolved. After waiting for 10 days I contacted them again and now they told me again to wait for 2 months. This is not what I expected from the bank.\\nI called Sears customer service line at XXXX, I needed to get my balance so the representative asked for my social security number I replied by saying that\\'s strange normally if they ask it\\'s usually the last four digits only but this person asked for the full number after I gave it to her she hung up. I called back told the new rep. what happened on my previous call and she said we don\\'t ask for your full social security number are you sure you dialed the right number?, I said yes thr rep. acted confused so I asked for a Supervisor the rep. stated she would do her best to get someone to call me back but I remain very concerned because she asked if I had made a purchase and I have not today, when I asked if she saw a purchase she would not answer.XXXX XX/XX/2019 XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX\\n\"A government travel card was issued through CITIBANK by the US XXXX  to use during official government travel. I was unaware that any further payments were due and thought it was paid off until I received a bill in XX/XX/XXXX after a last payment was made in XXXX XXXX. The bill was for the entire amount of the card, since they were unwilling to do monthly installments or payments and had incurred late charges. After being locked out of the account and being stationed overseas, I was finally able to make a partial payment that was worked out with CITIBANK on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX for {$1300.00}. However, this was not processed and on the statement read returned CK PAYMENT even though it was paid via phone with a confirmation email provided. Since XXXX, I have been XXXX leaving my wife a POA for my finances that are not joint.

My wife attempted to call the agency and representative XXXX ( # XXXX ) would not help her or accept my POA unless I could FAX the documents. Having no access to a fax machine I am left helpless since the internet is down on my XXXX  and unable to call in and complete this on my own. This company has been completely irrational with their payment demands and down right shady when consumers are attempting to make payments. There is no excuse for this lack of flexibility when working with military spouses especially when they are trying to solve problems for their XXXX spouses who have more important things to focus on.', 'Roughly around XX/XX/2019.

They basically repeated what I've been saying all along which is that they had my current address so there was no reason for them not mailing me a statement in the first place. The statement they said they mailed to me on XX/XX/XXXX was only acknowledged after several requests for them to send me a statement since they never sent the first statement that would have told me what I owed and the due date. \\n\\nThe message they sent on XX/XX/XXXX also stated that I owe them a minimum payment of {$59.00} which includes the late fee they assessed in error since they never sent me an initial statement, and of which they later said they waived. I am not unsure if that last message was stated in error or they have reneged on the late fee credit they already told me they gave me. \\n\\nI am most concerned, however, with the impact to my credit score by reporting I was late when in fact they never sent me a statement as they are required to do, and I do not trust that they will mail me future statements since to date I've not received a single statement in the mail from this bank.\", 'When I got my American Express plaitnum card XX/XX/XXXX and the XXXX XXXX XXXX  card on XX/XX/XXXX, they both comes with the benefit of Priority Pass Select which gives me access to lounges and non-lounges that cooperates with Priority Pass.

So after I clicked the wrong reason, I added the real reason in the notes, but I guess no one bothered to look at that part ...

So they closed my case ... I then called them, which was about a month ago in XX/XX/XXXXand told them the real reason I was disputing, which was because I tried to return the item but only store credit was being offered, and that was not how I paid for the item.

The merchant, ( XXXX ) refunded and canceled the payment back onto the prepaid card that day. Upon further waiting on the refund, I called XX/XX/2019 and the prepaid card company ( Card.com ) informed me that I would need to wait 3-7 business days for the funds to be applied back to the card. I was also informed if I wanted the funds sooner, I would need to do A Merchant Hold Letter basically stating a reason why they need to manually override the pending transaction. I had asked to put them on hold and do a 3-way call so my auto loan representative ( XXXX ) can get the proper information to faxing what they needed. It was faxed on XX/XX/2019 approximately at XXXX XXXX. I also submitted a email receipt from the auto loan stating the cancellation of the payment and refundable amount to the card. It is now going into XX/XX/2019. I had called again that XXXX and spoke to a representative ( Card.com ) about the refund. I had asked if they received the faxed from my auto loan people and I was informed that once faxed, it would 24 to 48 hrs to do a verification and if approved, they would override and release the funds. I had called back again same day to see about the fax and approval to getting the funds released. I was informed that I would now have to wait an additional 30-90 days for the investigation to be completed. I had asked why does it need to be investigated when I all the documents where accurately sent. I was told that it was a disputing transaction or refund would be applied back to the card no later than XX/XX/2019. I told the representative ( Card.com ) that was not accurate information that I was told in the beginning. The representative ( Card.com ) continuously repeated him/herself and wasnt trying to resolve my case based on what was said at first.

Didn\\'t receive the credit card and/or Comenity Bank \\'s first billing statement from David \\'s until on aroundXX/XX/19 reflecting the first payment due date of XX/XX/19. Received an email from David \\'s Bridal onXX/XX/19that dress was on it\\'s way ( already had appt scheduled forXX/XX/19to try dress on as that is the date the sales rep promised me the dress would be in ). \\n\\nPaid my first payment of the 6 month \\'s promotion onXX/XX/19. Picked up dress on XX/XX/19like promised. Paid every payment on time ( due every month on the XXXX )  with the exception of a few months where I paid several days earlier. Paid remaining balance of the promotional amount ( {$1400.00} ) on XX/XX/19.Every month statements were mailed to my house, however, every month I paid on online bill pay which were paid on or before the XXXX of each month until the balance was paid off by XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from David \\'s Bridal that said \"\" statement enclosed \\'. Knowing the balance was paid in full byXX/XX/19I went online to and download the XXXX statement only to then realize that my promotional balance must have been paid in full by XX/XX/XXXX, 2019 and not XX/XX/XXXX when the due date was. I called David \\'s Bridal and explained that I had not known they changed the promotional date. The rep stated that they never changed the due date but that the 6 months promotional started running 3 days after the date of purchase ( XX/XX/19 ) and not on the billing cycle date. I explained that I had not even received the dress until 1 month and 3 weeks later. I asked how they could justify charging me for something I hadn\\'t even received yet and start a promotional balance on an item I haven\\'t even received until at least 40-45 days later? \\n\\nI explained that I made my first payment ( after not receiving the dress yet ) as a responsible consumer because I knew the balance would have to be paid off in six months from the XXXX statement. The rep explained that I had 60 days to call into them to complain to them about my bill. I asked why would I complain about the bill when the bill amount was correct and that I knew the dress must be paid off within 6 months ( i.e. XXXX 2019 ). The representative told me that if she received a bill in the mail and had not yet received the product that she ... herself ... personally would have called Comenity bank to tell them she wasn\\'t paying for something she didn\\'t receive yet. Consequently, assuming that I had 60 days to call Comenity bank to let them know not to start the clock on the promotional interest, I had never received notice in writing or otherwise, advising me to call Comenity bank if I didn\\'t approve of the promotional billing date. More importantly, why would I call to complain about the six months promotional balance anyway??? As far as I was concerned, the balance was to be paid in full byXX/XX/19 which is exactly what I did. \\n\\nI further explained that I have utilized zero percent interest on over 20+ retailers and have never once in my life heard of the bank starting the promotional balance three ( 3 ) days after purchase of an item I didn\\'t even receive yet. Let \\'s assume my item wasn\\'t available, or possibly no longer came in that size, shape color, etc. If I would  have to re-order another dress then theoretically David \\'s Bridal/Comenity Bank would then have to alter that date for promotional purposes to the new dress \\'s order. She said no, I still would have been responsible to continue to pay my original promotional balance byXX/XX/19.Does that even make sense??? So I would have to pay a bank/retailer for an item I would never receive? \\n\\nIn addition, the representative said that the David \\'s Bridal/Comenity Bank notified me on each statement that the balance was due byXX/XX/19. I assure you, my eyes at XXXX are not that bad. I have 20/20 reading vision but because it\\'s the smallest print I didn\\'t see it at all for SIX MONTHS STRAIGHT. The Comenity Bank representative claims the color was in RED which it is not. It borders on the pale pink side at the very best ( PLEASE SEE ATTACHED COLOR PHOTOGRAPHS OF THEIR FIRST AND LAST INVOICES TO ME ). At no time at all is the promotional balance date listed or affixed to the front page or remittance stub for all that matter. It is however, cleverly placed on the second page of the statement behind the other papers in the smallest print and the palest color. Additionally, since I paid everything online and never once looked at the statements ( because they were being mailed to my house ) there was never anything notifying me on the front interface of their website to reflect that the promotional balance must be paid byXX/XX/19 instead oXX/XX/19. In addition to that, almost invariably, every blessed time I have used zero percent interest, the bank sends you an email either a month or two or a few days before to let you know the promotional date is expiring ( PLEASE SEE AN EXAMPLE FROM XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ). David \\'s Bridal/Comenity bank did not do that. They expected that I was able to read their pink small print to reflect that the balance must have been paid in full 5 days before my billing due date. I paid the balance off in full within the 6 month \\'s billing cycle and kept to my end of the bargain and they did not. \\n\\n\\nI want them to remove the {$130.00} of accrued interest they charged me on my David \\'s Bridal/Comenity Bank Credit Card ; reflect my balance owed on their credit card/charge card as zero and make sure they do not report any negative balance and/or charge offs to any credit agency as this is not a charge off situation it\\'s a fraudulent situation where they attempt to unilaterally choose a promotional billing due date without any input and/or say from the consumer and without sufficient or adequate knowledge of the consumer or for a date other than the billing cycle date.\"\\nI made my payment on childrens place  in total amount, and they said is past for a few minutes and they charge me late fee payments, I didnt know because I Paid in full I never expect one more bill I paid to them 3 late fee payment!!!!!

So I called the merchant and tried to resolve it with them, but was told it must be resolved with the bank. Meanwhile, the Bank of America associate said they would reopen the claim. When I called again yesterday to confirm this, I was put on hold and promised a return call but I was never called back. Bottom line is, I did not make this {$55.00} purchase. I have been a Bank of America credit card holder for 30 years.\\nTD bank credit card has charged me cash in advance in number of transactions which I did only and no cash withdrawn was made I have been making the same transaction with the same card for two years they never changed my any cash in advance fess for them until recently they started doing without notify me of any changes and never sent me any documents to make me aware of any change which is violated the terms and conditions I agreed about when I open the account with them .nevertheless, I already stop making the same online transaction once I noticed the fess they started charging me and a week later before all that happened I wasnt charge any cash in advance fess in I did the same type of transaction .also they charge me at the end of the month another fess again for the same transactions two fess difference time for the same transactions\\n\"My husband makes periodic charges on XXXX XXXX on behalf of my XXXXYO daughter. Because XXXX automatically keeps our credit card information on file, he has to take the extra step of removing our credit card after each purchase. If we could get a history of activity on XXXX, you would see that he does this every time he purchases something from XXXX XXXX on behalf of my daughter. XXXX keeps this information in their data files. On XX/XX/20, he authorized a charge on XXXX XXXX for {$19.00}. He removed the card before he handed the tablet back to her. \\n\\nUnbeknownst to him, XXXX kept the card on file and my daughter accidentally charged {$1500.00} in XXXX charges between XX/XX/20 - XX/XX/20. I learned of the charges on XX/XX/20 and contacted XXXX for a refund. They said it didn\\'t qualify since our card was in their system. My husband is very careful about removing the card after each purchase and says it had been removed. \\n\\nIn order to prove that he removed it, I asked XXXX for documentation concerning the account activity ( each click and command given ) for XX/XX/20 and I was told they could not provide that for me. This is the only way I can prove that my husband had removed the card so I have no recourse in getting these unauthorized charges refunded. \\n\\nAs of this writing, our credit card company, Chase Bank, also won\\'t refund us. They say that XXXX disputes our claim that these charges were unauthorized so they won\\'t credit the charges either. Additionally, Chase Bank \\'s fraud services failed us in notifying us of international charges ( XXXX is based in XXXX ) as I had indicated on our alerts and the fact that a company was charging our card repeatedly -- XXXX charges in less than a few hours -- and didn\\'t send me an alert or deny the charges based on suspicious activity. I feel as both XXXX and Chase are not offering the proper protection against the unauthorized charges that I\\'ve incurred. \\n\\nWe have disabled all purchase capabilities on XXXX due to this issue. We did all that we knew to do to avoid unauthorized charges and yet, when it happened, XXXX won\\'t refund us or provide the data needed to show that we removed the card. My complaint with Chase is that they didn\\'t notify me when suspicious charges were occurring ( there was no alert I could sign up for when charges are repeatedly sent through in a short period of time ) and when I notified them on XX/XX/20 that the charges were not authorized, they failed to deny payment to XXXX.', \"My XX/XX/2019 Citi Aadvantage Platinum Master Card statement had fees totaling {$3900.00}. I paid {$3500.00}. There was a balance of {$490.00}. On the XX/XX/2019 statement, I was charged {$100.00} interest on {$4600.00} ( D ) at 25.49 % ( V ). There is no justification for charging me {$100.00} on {$4600.00}, when the carryover was only {$490.00}. \\n\\nThe XX/XX/2019 balance was {$2500.00}. That included {$490.00} carryover and {$1900.00} in new charges ( which weren't yet due ). The total amount due on XX/XX/2019 in terms of charges and carryover was {$2400.00}. The amount that I should have paid interest on was {$490.00}. {$1900.00} were charges that weren't yet due and should not have been charged interest. \\n\\nAt no time during the billing cycle did the average daily balance exceed {$2400.00}. And yet, the bank charged interest on a balance of {$4600.00}. \\n\\nWhen I called to dispute the charge, I was transferred three times around the world to customer service agents who refused to allow me to speak with a supervisor or billing specialist. It took me one hour, 27 minutes and 31 seconds of speaking to three different customer service representatives, who refused to give me their last name or employee ID numbers and refused to involved a specialist or a supervisor, who repeatedly tried to tell me that the calculation was accurate. \\n\\nThe statements made by the customer service representatives were false. They lied repeatedly and consistently. The proof of the error is in Citi 's own bank statements. This kind of usury and predatory behavior is surely not legal. I'm sure that this is standard treatment at this bank, and likely at all banks and credit card operators. I'm sure that your service has had massive complaints about this. Will you help to stop this behavior? Clearly, I want my account credited and the interest to be fair and accurate. But I also want to stop this predatory behavior.\", 'I have a Capitol One credit card that is set up for automatic payment for the balance in full. After opening a new primary checking account with XXXX a Capital One representative advised me to denote it as the primary account from which payments would be made ; this was to be marked with a star. \\n\\nDespite the change, Capitol One deducted a payment from my old bank account ( XXXX XXXX ). The left the XXXX XXXX in an NSF position. I was charged {$35.00} and received additional notification from XXXX XXXX that the payment was not made. Moreover, my credit worthiness with XXXX XXXX has now been impaired. \\n\\nI contacted XXXX by phone, waiting 35 minutes to speak with a representative. The first person with whom I spoke had no idea how to handle the situation, so I asked her to escalate the call. I was then connected with somebody by the name of XXXX, a supervisor ( who later stated there was no person higher than him to whom I might escalate the situation ). \\n\\nHaving explained the problem to XXXX he said he could not view my account dashboard and was not aware that a primary payment account is denoted by a star. Moreover, he stated that he would not assist me as the situation was solely my fault. XXXX stated that I should have cancelled my auto payment from XXXX XXXX and set up a new auto payment from XXXX. Moreover, he told me my Capitol One account is now is now past-due. Again, this affects my credit rating and also comes with a hefty interest rate attached to the balance that would have been paid in full had Capitol One taken payment from the primary bank account noted on my dashboard. \\n\\nAlso note, Capitol One deducted payments from my XXXX XXXX account in XXXX and XXXX, but not in XXXX. And they did not deduct payment from my XXXX account in XXXX. \\n\\nPrior to this mess I had a credit rating above 800, no late payments and a spotless history with XXXX XXXX, XXXX and Capitol One. Now everything is a mess. \\n\\nMaking matters worse, XXXX would not assist further and ended the call. This has left me in the position of not knowing how to proceed to rectify the situation.\"\\nI opened a Citibank thank you premier card in XXXX XXXX. My whole experience with the card has been polluted with numerous instances where my card goes under review, I call up to resolve the situation, then it goes under review once again. Often this secondary review happens within hours after clearing the card. And each time, I have to spend hours on the phone to resolve the situation. This has happened almost weekly for the past XXXX months. When I call them they make promises that theyll call me back within XXXX2 business days. To no ones surprise, that call never comes, and I have to reach out to them again, only to have the same promises made, and the cycle continues. A little more than a week ago, I spoke to a supervisor who assured me that the issues are resolved and that this wont happen again. Foolishly, I believed the supervisor. To his credit, the card didnt go under review again until a week later, the longest time the card had not been under review between reviews. Alas, however, the review came. And after spending XXXX5 hours of phone time ( mostly in hold ) with them today, holding my XXXX so I wouldnt lose service in the bathroom, I am sitting here with promises of a call back that will surely be broken once again. This is beyond frustrating at this point. And I have not even been able to use my card so I may not be able to hit my minimum spend amount required to take advantage of their sign up rewards bonus. Speaking of which, I did not receive my thank you points for the second month of spending until I had to call the thank you points line to have them adjust it. I imagine that this hold is the reason for it. I anticipate that being the case with this month, once again.\\nTo Whom It May Concern, I am writing to report the closing of my Citibank XXXX XXXX Advantage credit card account. The basis for closing was that my credit union rejected the payment request by Citibank. My credit union denied the payment because Citibank listed my wife as the primary card holder when in fact she was an authorized user. I attemped a {$1000.00} online payment to my Citibank credit card on XXXX, 2019, which was rejected. My credit union checking account does not include my wife on the account and therefore rejected the request by Citibank. I contacted my credit union and was informed what occured. I was told to have Citibank correct the card holder information. Once corrected, the credit union could process future payment requests. I tried to resolve the issue with multiple Citibank phone representatives who could also see that my other Citibank Thank you card which was linked to the same checking account was paid on the same day without a problem. I explained what my credit union had told me was the reason for the payment rejection. I was told that they could not reopen my account because that was Citibank policy. They were all sympathetic to my situation as they could see that the rejection was not based on insufficient funds. I explained to them that this unilateral action by Citibank was unfair because I had no liablity in the situation. My credit report score has dropped since my available credit has been reduced. The two financial institutions were not communicating and I was punished by having my credit card account closed. As a consumer, I believe that my rights were violated because I was denied any due process to resolve this issue before my account was closed. I do not believe the facts support a basis for closing my account. Therefore, I am writing to CFPB for assistance in having my account reopened.\\n\"I applied for the JetBlue MC back in XX/XX/XXXX through an application given while in flight and collected before landing ; a few weeks after applying I received a letter from Barclays stating that I could not get the card because the terms offered on the card that I applied for ended.

I continued to pay my current month charges in full and was charged more interest each month and continued to deduct the additional interest charges along with the disputed amount. Bank of America has refused to credit my account for the interest which now amounts to over {$400.00}. They state that only the interest that is related to the duplicate charge is refunded not the interest on the monthly charges THAT ACCRUED DUE TO THE DISPUTED AMOUNT NOT BEING CREDITED. if the original disputed amount had been credited in the first place there would have been no interest charges since I pay off my balance IN FULL each month. I have called repeatedly and they tell me that they will review and never bother to notify me of the determination and in the meantime interest continues to pile up. This can not be legal.

The granite I had chosen from online actually turned out to be a laminate, so I paid {$75.00} for a home measurement where the scheduler would call two days later. I waited over a week and no one called, so I called Lowe \\'s XXXX, AL and was transferred three times, then placed on hold and then transferred to some lady in corporate. She was very rude and disconcerting, kept me on the phone for 15 minutes with nonsense. She could not find my file and stated that I did not have an order.

I filed a complaint with the XXXX where I received an email and a phone call from Lowe \\'s corporate office.

He had previously quoted an estimate of {$1200.00} for the laminate and {$2500.00} for the granite. After measurement, the estimate for the laminate was {$2100.00}, so I decided to go with the granite. I went into the store to contract, and the sales rep could not remember ever giving an estimate for granite, so I refreshed his memory by showing him the granite I had previously chose. He stated that a fabricator needed to be sent out for the granite estimate at no charge - thank God. Now we are up to around XX/XX/2019. I waited a week for the fabricator to call and called the sales rep who stated that the fabricator had tried calling and had left a VM msg - I do not have voice mail. \\n\\nThe problem was that I had assumed the phone call was a telemarketer and hung up. The fabricator called after about a week and a half and set an appointment for the estimate.

All the charges and transactions on both credit card accounts are fraudulent charges and not my charges.\\n\"On XX/XX/XXXX, I signed a contract for a timeshare/vacation club with a XXXX based company doing business in XXXX. The next day, XX/XX/XXXX, I tried to use the benefits that I was told that I had and was told that the customer service agent didn\\'t see said benefits. I knew that I had a 5 day window to cancel so I tried again the next day, XX/XX/XXXX, to no avail. On XX/XX/XXXX, I went to the sales office and requested to cancel the membership. I was told that they could not because they have no consumer cancellation clause within their contract. On the same day, XX/XX/XXXX, I went on the membership page top contact customer support in order to get email information of speaking with someone to handle cancellations. I was given various email addresses to which I sent the cancellation request to each. On the same date, XX/XX/XXXX, I received a reply stating that someone would contact me within 72 to discuss. \\n\\nFrom there, I contacted Chase, the issuer of my credit card, to file a dispute. On that call I asked if I needed to provide anything and was told that if anything was needed that someone would contact me. About 31 days later I received a call from a dispute rep stating that they were handling my account and they asked for clarification on the case which I provided. I had not heard anything else until XX/XX/XXXX when I received a call from a customer support specialist named XXXX who advised me that Chase had found the charge to be valid. I was dumbfounded. I asked for explanation and she told me that the merchant mentioned not receiving a request for cancellation, as well as, the contract not have a consumer cancellation clause. From there I told XXXX that the law within the jurisdiction that is mentioned in the contract states that a consumer cancellation clause MUST be included in any timeshare/vacation club contracts and that the company committed fraud. I also explained that I had proof that I provided the merchant with a cancellation request. She suggested that I send a request to reopen the case one the actual document was received in the mail. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received the notice from Chase in the mail once I got home from work and immediately sent the request to reopen the case to the email address provided, along with documents labeled \"\" Chase Document, \\'\\' Exhibit A, \\'\\' Exhibit B, \\'\\' and \"\" Exhibit C \\'\\' for review. I called to see it the documents were received and was told that they were not and to wait a few days. I did and called back but still nothing so I resent the info. Waited and still no word. I sent it again and two days later, the documents were in my file. From there I wanted for a status but got nothing. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called to obtain a status update and was told that it was solved and that they deemed the charge valid again. I asked for the reason yet again and was told that the notice cited \"\" no new information that could be used. \\'\\' This confused me since everything that I submitted was new and the laws are clearly outlined and highlighted so no one had to search for anything. \\n\\nI asked to speak to a manager and was transferred to the disputes supervisor, XXXX. XXXX was rude, overtalked me and when I asked her to slow down so that I can understand her and ask specific question, she got frustrated and even more rude. She informed me that my cardmember agreement states that I have 60 days to file a dispute for errors on my account and that those 60 days had passed. I explained to her that I filed the original dispute 3 days after the charge was made. She responded stating that the time does not stop once I file the dispute so it is pass time to compel the merchant to return the funds. I mentioned to her that it was over 90 days before the original dispute was resolved and that I was told that I can request to have the same case reopened. She was frustrated and so was I. I hung up and called back hoping to speak with someone new. The original representative transferred me right back to her and she was even more rude than before. I asked for the number to a corporate office and was denied, I asked who I could speak with that was above her and was denied. I asked is there anyone that can explain the reasoning to me and was denied. I then asked XXXX if the 60 day time period that she told he has lapsed, was mentioned in the notice. She would not answer directly and finally after some back and forth she mentioned that it was in the notes and not the notice. I then called Chase customer service and asked if there was a way to escalate my plight and was given an address and email address. \\n\\nOnce I arrived home, I did some research on this 60 day clause mentioned by XXXX and found that I actually have 60 days after the billing cycle to file. I did so before the billing cycle on XX/XX/XXXX ( Billing cycle ended on XX/XX/XXXX ). I also found that, according to the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), Chase has to resole the issue within 2 billing cycles, not to exceed 90 days. Chase took 3 billing cycles ( XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ). The notice that I received on XX/XX/XXXX from Chase is dated XX/XX/XXXX ( 92 days since my original complaint. \\n\\nAccording to the FTC website, ( XXXX XXXX   XXXX ), \"\" The creditor must acknowledge your complaint, in writing, within 30 days after receiving it, unless the problem has been resolved. The creditor must resolve the dispute within two billing cycles ( but  not more than 90 days ) after getting your letter. \\'\\' It also states that, \"\" Any creditor who fails to follow the settlement procedure may not collect the amount in dispute, or any related finance charges, up to {$50.00}, even if the bill turns out to be correct. For example, if a creditor acknowledges your complaint in 45 days 15 days too late or takes more than two billing cycles to resolve a dispute, the penalty applies. The penalty also applies if a creditor threatens to report or improperly reports your failure to pay during the dispute period. \\'\\' I believe that due to both the merchant, as well as, Chase not following regulation, I should be refunded the {$15000.00} charge that was initiated on XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nI have attached all documents for review.', 'I had a credit card account open with Huntington bank. I opened the account a little under 3 years ago as my first line of credit outside of student loans. With this they provided me with a {$4000.00} line of credit. This happened to be before i frequently checked my credit score so I am unsure what it was at this time. Considering I had not other credit line except for student loan debt I assume it was not that high. A few months after having the card my credit line was raised to {$8000.00} without a notification from them which was good with me. At this time I had a car loan and just got a full time job and was still in school. Through some time in work I had to take off time in classes and my student loans started needing paid. Since it was in multiple loans I decided to have them consolidated to make things easier. During this time I was advised to wait until the consolidation was finished. During this time my credit did take a hit but went back up higher then it was previously. Around the time my credit went back to its normal amount they lowered my credit limit to {$1600.00} due to me being a \"\" risk. \\'\\' I was a little upset by this, but they let me know I could call to have it raised in a 6 month span. During all of this time I had never missed a payment on my credit card and other then the student loan issue had not blemishes on my record for unpaid bills. As of XX/XX/XXXX when I had last used the card they ran another report which showed my credit limit was very different from multiple other credit agencies. They did not notify me until XX/XX/2019 that my account was closed in XX/XX/XXXX. Due to this I was unable to redeem the 90,000+ points I had saved up which in their system every XXXX points is ~ {$1.00}. When I called their support their reasoning was that I am to much of a risk to leave it open and there is nothing they can do. I re-ran my credit score and it had went up. They said there is no way for me to reopen the card or redeem the points. Even after speaking to a supervisor they said that I would have to reapply in 6 months. I let them know I would be closing my checking account that I had also had with them for almost 10 years to make sure the bank nearest to me was ready for me close my account. Not understanding at all she said she would file a complaint on my behalf.\"\\nI am forced to issue this complaint about Capital One as a matter of course due to their unwillingness to validly explain their case, and their continued and seeming willful obfuscations and continued emphasis on insisting that all their corporate actions are upstanding.  This is a valid dispute, despite Capital One’s intimations to the contrary, on account of Capital One furnishing derogatory data damaging my credit and using the unconscionable tactic of pushing through some judgment, getting a clerk to sign off on it that shows up on my public record.  Capital One, it seems, has chosen to ignore about half of my points in my last dispute.  I’m assuming because they can’t answer those and haven’t been able to in the last two months they’ve had to answer them?  Consumer protection laws were put into place to protect the consumer from the abusive practices that entities like Capital One and their agents are known to engage in and have a lengthy history of engaging in. Furthermore, It is not my responsibility to verify my data with Capital One in order to obtain the same hearsay documents (loan agreement without the terms of a contract, copies of bills of half the years the account was allegedly in existence).  It is not my responsibility to verify this, it is Capital One’s responsibility to verify their accuracy when they are furnishing derogatory data and claiming to have a judgment. If, as Capital One states, they are not obligated to provide affidavits attesting to the accuracy of all the documents they sent in their last answer regarding their business records, then all they forwarded was hearsay documentation, regarding those two 200+ page PDF files with the bills from XXXX on. This is not a customer service complaint about a XXXX fee, or some other minor matter, this, and my prior complaints are complaints to the CFPB about Capital One’s egregious violations of the Unfair Deceptive Abusive Or Acts Or Practices (UDAAP).  Yet they continue to “verify” the veracity of the data they furnish. Since Capital One states in their response to me that they don’t have to provide affidavits about attempts to “void a lawful debt you owe Capital One”, I will use the definition of the word, “verify” in its legal sense.  As per XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, Verification is “Confirmation of correctness, truth or authenticity by affidavit, oath or deposition.” By continuing to verify data and willfully refusing to work within the parameters of “lawful”, as Capital One phrases it, they are engaging in a fraudulent misrepresentation of the circumstance, a violation of the UDAAP. In my last complaint I referred to the court’s refusal to acknowledge my interrogatories of the facts of the judgment they allegedly entered against me.  Sending a generic form showing the verdict doesn’t show the standing of the case. It doesn’t show how this court fulfilled the NYS civil procedure, in particular 3215 (f), particularly upon Capital One’s states refusal in their response that they have no need to submit affidavits. The court’s refusal to respond to my certified letters and Capital One’s continued forwarding of this statement that there was a judgment and lack of explanation as to how this clerk who signed off on this judgment didn’t commit a fraud on the court by not attesting to following the elements of state law in this matter. Capital One states in response to my last complaint that XXXX XXXX XXXX “followed all applicable laws and regulations in the handling of your account.”  Well, I wasn’t quite expecting them to say they don’t follow those laws.  Given their past track record, which I documented in my last dispute, their statement of following laws and regulations doesn’t hold much weight.  I don’t need to communicated with XXXX XXXX XXXX.  I have not entered into a contract with them nor have I consented into any agreement with them of any sort and have no interest in any business dealing with them, nor want them in possession of my personal identifying information, and as they are not furnishing derogatory data to the bureaus they are not my concern.  They are merely agents of Capital One’s in this matter and it is Capital One that I am filing this complaint about.  Also, as per the attached Affidavit of Service I closed in the response, the process server attests to having communicated with a “Mr. XXXX”, who allegedly was qualified to speak on whether I was a member of the military or not.  The due diligence here wasn’t due diligence enough as there is no Mr. XXXX   qualified to speak on my status in any way, shape or form. That affidavit should be voided on account of perjury.  Capital One, in their response, and despite their claim that Capital One follows all laws and regulations, still has not addressed the point I raised in my last complaint that they violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) by never having notified me in the first place that they were placing derogatory data about me to the bureaus. My “request” for Capital One to cease furnishing derogatory information about me and their continued act of  “verifying” said information without having establish a basis for verification in its legal definition, established by Capital One’s stated and willing refusal to submit any affidavits attesting to the accuracy of this data, is not a request.  It is a demand, as Capital One continues to willfully contravene their own statement that they follow all laws and regulations.  Furthermore, as I have no accounts with Capital One, I demand they remove all of the data they have in their possession on me.  On account of the recent data breach of over 100 million customers, it is apparent that Capital One cannot guarantee and certainly appears to be incapable of guaranteeing the security and privacy of any information they possess.  Their transgressions towards the consumer that I have documented here and in my prior complaints, combined with their disregard for safeguarding customer data make it clear that this is a company that consumer protection laws were created to safeguard the consumer against!\\nI had a Bank of America BANKAMERICARD where I had a $XXXX   minimum payment due each month that I had set to be automatically paid from my bank account each month. I had this set up by a banker when I received the card. Upon moving to my new house, my billing information and address changed which messed up my automatic billing and all communication with the bank via mail. I do all of my communication with the bank through the mail and this is how I check the amount of money that is due on my card and if my payments had successfully gone through.  Therefore, relocating to a new address caused my automatic payment to fail which caused me to be delinquent on my BANKAMERICARD account for the months of XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/2018. Not knowing that my automatic payment was messed up caused this issue and it was compounded when my address change caused the mail that the bank was sending me to go to my old address. This cut off all communication with me and the bank and I was unaware that I was missing a payment until an associate at Bank of America called me on XX/XX/2018 to let me know that the account was delinquent. I then immediately made the payment that I was owed to the bank.\\n\"I went to kohls. I spent XXXX dollars. The lady working asked me if I wanted to open a credit card. She said I would save 35 % on my total purchase. I told her for 35 % on XXXX bucks. It is worth it. So I agreed. She then ran my information and after I was approved she scanned her coupon for opening the account. I saw XXXX dollars taken off my total. I said to her, 35 % of XXXX is not XXXX bucks and she said I dont know what happened. She asked another cashier and the other cashier said most the items I was purchasing does not qualify for the 35 %. Well, the lady who opened my account said. Sorry I didn\\'t know about the exclusions because I\\'m only seasonal help. I did not have my credit ran to save XXXX dollars. I was livid about it and especially not being disclosed all the information about opening the card. I asked to speak to a manager and they said there is nothing they can do. I also called corporate and they said there is nothing they can do about me getting the 35 % percent off as promised. I should not be liable for the whole amount charged to the card. I have been scammed for opening a credit card and they are acting like it is no big deal.', 'On XX/XX/XXXX I visited XXXX to verify a balance on an unused {$25.00} Debit MasterCard Prepaid card with an expiration of XX/XX/XXXX. I received repeated error messages. I attempted to phone the 866 number listed on the card, but that number was no longer in service. After an internet search, I found the XXXX number for the card. I called and spoke with an agent named XXXX, who could not pull up any information with the given card number. She could not figure out why her system was not locating the card. She guessed that either the card was defective, or that the card \\'s balance was run down to XXXX  and the card information may have been purged from the system. I queried how this could happen, and she mentioned that some cards can have inactivity fees associated with them. She could not confirm any of this information, and these were her best guesses. I was puzzled and alarmed, as the expiration date of the card is XX/XX/XXXX, and I believe that all pertinent consumer information related to the card should be readily available until that date. After some discussion, XXXX advised me to file a complaint to receive a call back from upper management. She took down my email, phone number and name and said it would take 24 hours to hear back. \\n\\nAfter 72 hours of not hearing back, over 15 phone calls to US Bank ( card owner ), Mastercard ( logo on the card ), and the 866 number listed above ( on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ) each agent contradicted the previous agent. Nobody could provide helpful information or figure out why I had not received a call back. Each time, no information on my previous calls could be located, and I had to repeat the entire scenario all over again. \\n\\nI finally received a call back from XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, who reported AGAIN that the card number could not be located on file. She could not provide any information as to why this was happening, but GUESSED that the card value was XXXX. She could not offer a resolution. When queried about her department or role, she reported that she worked for \"\" cardmember services \\'\\'. No other specific information could be provided. I politely thanked her for her time, but also informed her about my level of frustration, repeated lack of assistance and contradictory information by her department, and indicated that my next step would be to contact the CFPB and XXXX  regarding this experience. She, again, took down my information, and said that a member from the escalation department \"\" may or may not \\'\\' reach out with a resolution, and there was no specific timeline for this unguaranteed contact. \\n\\nI believe that this card was sold under false pretenses and that the associated card management companies are using deceptive practices. Service agents intentionally use vague language, provide inaccurate timelines, and refuse to disclose company information or contact information to allow consumer reporting and proper follow up. Any associated fees, including inactivity fees, were not conspicuously displayed at the time of purchase to the purchaser or gift card recipient ( myself ) and I believe violates the CARD ACT. Furthermore, the state of purchase and the state that I reside in does not permit these fees. \\n\\nI would appreciate a replacement card issued by US Bank National Association in the amount of {$25.00}. \\n\\nThank you for your time and review of this matter.', 'In Response to CFPB Complaint # XXXX and Capital One Case # XXXX Back on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX called me and said she was going to dig deeper into my case, and that not to worry because she actually handles cases such as mine ...

The application was to my Citibank Mastercharge account. The vehicle was the Citibank mobile app. I followed the instructions and when I completed the transaction it stated I had transferred the full balance owed ( {$10000.00} ) instead of the other amount of {$250.00}. I immediately tried to cancel the transaction but there was no feature to do so. I called the bank and was told that the checking side saw the transaction but couldn\\'t reverse the transaction but the credit card side could. I transferred to the credit card side and at first they couldn\\'t see the transaction. After going back and forth the credit card side saw the transaction and said they could transfer the money back in 3 to 5 days. This has caused my checking account to become overdrawn. I was unlucky. I have overdraft protection so that plus my balance allowed the transaction to go through. My compliant is having to wait 3 to 5 days for the funds to go back to the account when it is the same financial institution just different sections. I will probably incur overdraft charges because all my bills are coming in on ACH \\'s. The bank should be able to instantly return funds if it is an intabank transaction but for some reason they didn\\'t anticipate people mistakenly paying more than intended. I have used their app twice and had problems twice. I have told them I will never use their app for any transaction again. I know that you can\\'t help me as by the time you see this and act, the money should be back.

The item was defective and returned 12 days after in XX/XX/2019 via XXXX with tracking number XXXX. The item was initially refunded and all was well. XX/XX/2019, the credit card was charged again for this item and that is when everything went downhill with chase. Someone had opened a dispute with them and they stated we had to submit tracking information for the return of this item. When there was no response they closed it in favor of the seller. We had no idea that there was even a dispute. The letter received was online and because we did not know there was a dispute, because neither of us recall contacting chase, we did not look at the online letters. If that was the case, we would have promptly provided the documentation needed to be refunded. After talking with amazon and chase for over a month because somehow, a dispute was reopened. Tracking information was provided again and on XX/XX/XXXX, we received another letter from chase stating the charge was valid. After speaking with XXXX with chase disputes in XXXX XXXX Texas, he stated that the charge was valid and deemed valid because the tracking information was not provided in the initial time frame on the initial dispute. Basically, after reopening the the dispute, the tracking information provided on the second time disputed was not looked at and that the only way that we can dispute this again is to write a written letter disputing it and why we are disputing it. This is for over 1000 dollars and tracking information as well as documentation from amazon and the seller provides proof that the charge is not valid. We were not asked to provide any other information this time other than tracking so if the tracking was not going to be enough, I should have been told this one of the 23 times I called about this dispute. This is an illegal practice and there is no legal way that this charge is even valid. Their process for determining that this is a legal charge is not right and should be corrected along with all the time and money Ive spent disputing this charge. The seller stated that the item was returned and that they refunded a smaller portion due to signs of use and the item was working which is not fair either because the item did not work.

Capital One/Visas shared definition of fraud, is at best, incomplete and needs to fully reflect all legal definitions of fraud. \\n\\nAlso, allowing corporations to arbitrarily and capriciously define time periods for crimes like identity theft and fraud as anything less than the full seven year statute of limitations is unwise and highly questionable.\\n\\nI had depended on Capital One to help protect myself from, what I will charitably describe as questionable business practices ; in this they have demonstrably failed. I am requesting that the FTC require that Capital One use the full legal definition ( s ) of Fraud and instruct them to refund all of the {$2400.00}. \\n\\nThis only represents my direct loss, and does not include the time Ive spent on the phone, writing claims, researching legal remedies and writing complaints, which now totals well over 40 hours. \\n\\nThank you for your consideration in this important matter. \\n\\nXXXX XXXX\"\\nHello, my name is XXXX XXXX XXXX and I can not seem to fully use all of my credit cards full credit line of {$300.00} plus paid an extra {$25.00} extra and for some reason charged an extra {$10.00} fee out of know wear.

When the customer service representative was reading the disclosure before finally canceling the account, I suddenly lost connection to the call due to the poor network connection. I thought the process of account closure would not be completed, as they would need to finally ask for my approval after the disclosure. I also changed my mind, and decided to keep the account open until XXXX 2020 when the annual fee is due. \\n\\nHowever, I was very surprised to see my account closed on the next day, therefore I immediately called customer service. An agent and a supervisor named XXXX both advised that the account would be reinstated, and the supervisor offered XXXX rewards points as compensation for inconvenience. The supervisor also advised that she was working with other departments to try to get the card delivered to me as soon as possible. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I realized that the account was not reinstated as promised, when I was trying to add the card to my online account via online chat. I then called customer service again, and was advised that the previous request for account reinstatement was declined due to my recent FICO score being around XXXX, which is not bad though. As such, I submitted an internal complaint to American Express, since there would not have been such a problem if they did not close the account without my final approval. \\n\\nI then called the department related to the specific card type, and was advised by a supervisor named XXXX that technically they would not be able to reinstate it at all, since this type of card is no longer open for applications. I then realized that the previous agent and supervisor gave me wrong information, which caused extreme confusion and frustration and should not happen. XXXX offered XXXX rewards points as compensation. I mentioned that last time the supervisor also offered the same, but I had not received it. XXXX responded that there was not such a note in the system, therefore they would not honor it. She also refused to acknoledge the existence of promise for compensation in my previous conversation with XXXX. \\n\\nIn the end, they would not reinstate my account, which was closed due to their mistake, and refused to honor the compensation as promised. I have spent two hours in phone calls regarding this problem and got extremely frustrated, and also lost my account which has been open for three years.', 'Suntrust Bank is refusing to resolve a claim. \\n\\n1.

They accepted the claim even after 60 days from the billing date and under review process instead of helping customer they are closing the case. It shows how poor is their customer service. \\n\\nI even talk to their supervisor/manager regarding the claim. They too are not interested in resolving instead they said i can close the account when i mentioned how other banks are always ready to help the customer. They are not willing to make any exception.

So far they have sided with the merchant citing the following response \"\"Unfortunately, we are unable to resolve this dispute in your favor since we have not received any documentation showing the merchant was unwilling or unable to provide this service.\"\"I feel like Citibank is not reading the evidence I have submitted and are siding with the merchant whom has not been truthful. I provided all of the requested information over a month ago in the form of a 34 page document with email transcripts and phone log screen shots.  Below is a summary, enclosures and call logs are attached.Background:My wife and I purchased a new construction home in XXXX, Florida to be completed in the spring of 2019. Since we were living in a temporary home with all of our belongings in storage, we were in a hurry to get moved in.  Also during this time I was traveling often for my work (as an XXXX XXXX United States XXXX). We also decided, that while the home was vacant (before move in) would be the best time to have the garage floor coated along with the back covered patio.Timeline:XX/XX/2019 – XX/XX/2019As we were constructing the home, I reached out to XXXX XXXX   XXXX  (XXXX) via a form on their website, inquiring about the services they offered.  From the first contact on XX/XX/2019 we exchanged a few emails back and forth over the next two months until we were able to meet at the property for a face to face meeting.   (Please see Enclosure 1 to review the entire transcript of the original scope of the project and the meeting at the property to select a color.)XX/XX/2019XXXX XXXX I met XXXX from XXXX out at my property.  I selected a color and she agreed to prepare a quote.XX/XX/2019The official proposal was sent over.XX/XX/2019XXXX  followed up with an email to see if I had any questions with the proposal. Throughout that day we discussed scheduling my flooring install and my ability to pay the deposit, because I was on the road traveling for work.  (See Enclosure 2 to see the entire transcript of this discussion)****** Expectation Set******At this point on XXXX XXXX, as I understood the “Installation Agreement” (See Enclosure 3 “Project Start Date” and “Estimated Days For Completion”)  My understanding was that this process would begin on XXXX XXXX and would take 4 days to complete.XX/XX/2019 ContinuedI received the Installation Agreement and executed it, I also received Invoice #XXXX for $XXXX and paid it.   Invoice #XXXX then turned into the transaction in question with this dispute.AFTER PAYING THE INVOICE: (Still XX/XX/2019)I emailed XXXX with questions concerning the installation.  My main question was that I was leaving the state (Traveling to Washington D.C) on the last day of the installation and I wanted to know if that was going to pose a problem with the install.  On XX/XX/2019 at XXXX XXXX, I received an email from XXXX  at XXXX  XXXX  saying that “It may not take all four days, but I like to have a little cushion just in case.”  I assumed this statement meant that my leaving would not impact the installation at all. (See Enclosure 4 to see the entire transcript of this discussion.  The previous quote was taken from the email timestamped XX/XX/2019 XXXX XXXX)XX/XX/2019 (First sign of trouble)I receive an email from XXXX at XXXX.  She stated “Good morning! We are set to work on your project on the week scheduled. We have another job (commercial) that was extended to that week as well, so I am unable to give you a start time on that Monday. Will the garage and back porch be accessible during the day?”I replied that the property was vacant and that I could have my wife meet her at the property and let her in.  She then sends a second email, confirming the start date of Tuesday  XXXX  XXXX.  I asked when she would start as my wife would need to leave to go to work by XXXX XXXX.  XX/XX/2019XXXX emails and states that she has no idea when the start time of my project would be.  I agree to “leave a key” accessible for her crew.XX/XX/2019  **** PROJECT PLANNED START DAY****XXXX XXXX: I email XXXX to disclose the location of the key and to clarify the installation of the coating on my back porch.XXXX XXXX: I arrive at the property, there was to no crew present and no work being completed.XXXX XXXX: I email XXXX asking “Is it safe to assume you guys are not coming today?” (See enclosure 5, email timestamped XX/XX/2019 XXXX   XXXX)XXXX XXXX: XXXX replies to me email confessing that the product to perform my job hasn’t even been received yet by XXXX. (See enclosure 5, email timestamped XX/XX/2019 XXXX XXXX)XXXX XXXX: I reply reminding XXXX  that my wife and I are leaving Friday and ask how this impacts my install. (See enclosure 5, email timestamped XX/XX/2019 XXXX XXXX)XXXX XXXX: I email her letting her know that my movers are waiting on her to get the floor down before I can move in. (See enclosure 5, email timestamped XX/XX/2019 XXXX XXXX)XXXX XXXX: XXXX replies saying “we will get the flakes down on Thursday. XXXX generally runs by noon. You dont have to be there for us to topcoat. We can lock everything back up and leave you the key. Lets move forward with this week. It will still be done on Friday and you can move things in as soon as you return!”(See Enclosure 5 to see the entire transcript of this discussion)XX/XX/2019XXXX XXXX: I arrive at my property expecting to see the first coat of flooring down and the flake “ready to go.”  On arrival, I see that there again are no workers at my property.XXXX XXXX: I call XXXX at XXXX to get an update.  The call goes to voicemail.  ALL calls to XXXX at XXXX  go to voicemail.****** Expectation Set******At this point I am less than 14 hours away from leaving the state.  My 4 day long project is in day 3 with no forward movement.  At this point I don’t even know if the product is there or not. To say that I am “in a panic” would be an understatement.  Compound that with the fact that XXXX at XXXX will not call me back.XX/XX/2019 ContinuedXXXX XXXX: I get an email from XXXX saying “Rain is coming” but she has no firm answers on moving forward with my project.XXXX XXXX: I leave XXXX a voicemailXXXX XXXX: I leave XXXX a voicemailXXXX pm: I leave XXXX a voicemail(See Enclosure 6, This is a copy of the call logs from my phone XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX)XXXX XXXX: I try emailing her.  My email contains the phrase “Please call me, your lack of communication is troubling.” (See enclosure 7 email timestamped XX/XX/2019 XXXX XXXXXX/XX/2019XXXX XXXX: I received an email (STILL NOT A CALL) from XXXX at XXXX   CANCELING our contract.  She also notifies me that she wants to keep a portion of my deposit.  (Section 8a of the Installation agreement stipulates she is entitled to a portion of the deposit if I terminate the contract.  I did not terminate the contract.  The contract was terminated by XXXX, and I am entitled to my deposit to be returned. (enclosure 7 email timestamped XX/XX/2019 at XXXX)Had my plane taken of on-time, I would have been airborne.(See enclosure 7 for a transcript of the email chain from Thursday XXXX XXXX through Friday XX/XX/2019)', 'At the presentation of the Loan Agreement  for financing  roofing work with Lowe\\'s Advantage Loan the Salesman XXXX XXXX showed me in paper my monthly payment. The monthly payment showed $XXXX per month. That was in XX/XX/XXXX. Later in XX/XX/XXXX, I get an invoice for monthly payment of $XXXX. I immediately contacted XXXX XXXX and asked why such huge increase. He called be back and said \"\" Next month and going forward your monthly payment will be restored to $XXXX per month and you will get credit for the excess payment\"\".  Well since then, no adjustment had been paid despite my communication with XXXX and Synchrony Bank which actually financed the Loan.  I want Synchrony Bank/Lowes to roll back to the initial payment arrangement Presented by Salesman XXXX XXXX.  I am sure these companies have misrepresented and cheated several consumers by presenting False documents at Presentation and Later changed the interest rate to Rip Off Consumer s.  I talked and text XXXX several times with no response. I also e-mailed to Synchrony Bank with no response.My second complaint is; The Gutter and Downspout fell during the Storm. I contacted Lowes and XXXX to fix the fallen Down Spout.  No response neither one.  I had to pay a Vendor to fix the issue.I request CFPB to restore the monthly payment to $XXXX per month and issue me credit for the over payment of $XXXX per month since XX/XX/XXXX. I will also file a Civil Suit with The XXXX XXXX County Court at XXXX XXXX , MD.Several Consumers have been coned / lied/ cheated by Lowe\\'s and  Synchrony Bank.', 'I have a an account with Synchrony Financial through their Amazon Store Card. The card offers XXXX XXXX back on Amazon purchases, as well as the option for promotional financing on qualifying orders. These orders allow for deferred interest for periods dependent on the amount of the order. \\n\\nWhen logged in online at https : //amazon.syf.com/, you can manage your account settings. One such setting is the way you want payments allocated. I have since the beginning selected the option to allocate my payments first to the non promotional balance of my account. The option reads as follows : \"\" Any payment you make ( including the required minimum payment due and any additional amounts ) will be applied to the non-promotional balance before the deferred interest promotional balance. Please note, even with this setting, during a billing period in which a deferred interest promotion expires, if your payment is enough to pay off the expiring promotion, your payment will be applied to the expiring promotion first before the non-promotional and other balances on your account. \\'\\' Almost every time I make a payment, the payment is instead allocated to my promotional balance. This results in me carrying a balance subject to interest, especially when I do not follow up with the payment. After all, I have made a selection clearly to allocate them to the non promotional balance. I would have no reason to expect it to be allocated otherwise. \\n\\nThe most recent example was a payment made on XX/XX/2020, before doing so I made sure that my selection was the option I described previously. It was when I checked, but I saved it again to be sure. I made a payment for the exact amount of my non-promotional balance. On XX/XX/2020 I checked and it had been allocated to my promotional balance! \\n\\nI contacted customer service chat and had it manually allocated, but they told me gave me several unlikely explanations : that my selection would take 1-2 weeks to process ( even though there was no change ), that it was a technical glitch, and that I had selected a different option. \\n\\nThen they told me I would have to have it manually allocated each time, something they have told me before. If that is the case, the page with the allocation options is outright deceitful! \\n\\nI am tired of having interest charged or wasting my time on customer service interactions any time I want to make a payment!\"\\nMissed two payments in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, but I became up-to-date on my payments and paid the entire card off as of XX/XX/XXXX.\\n\"It started on XX/XX/2019. Between XXXX XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, the criminals charged more than XXXX on my AMEX Bloomingdale \\'s account. Yesterday ( XX/XX/19 ) I got a letter from Bloomingdale \\'s Fraud Department saying their investigation was complete and that I owed XXXX. They say I am responsible for the charges in question. They said my account can only be accessed by the card issued by them. And that it was used at a chip enabled card reader. I have been a customer at Bloomingdales for about 73 years. Never a late payment. Never make large charges as these are. Or at the places these were charged. They can see that if they review my history with them. \\n\\nI have both my cards. Fraud Dept. told me the criminals have my birth date, social security number and a lot more of my personal info. The fraud dept. knows a lot more than they are telling me. The criminal wife was called on one of their large purchases and said that it was okay. that her husband had made it. i haven\\'t had a husband since XXXX. \\n\\nI have been dealing with the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX police, Sargent XXXX XXXX ( phone XXXX XXXX XXXX ) head of the crime department of the XXXX XXXX police, the three credit companies ( froze them ).

Bloomingdales case # is XXXX. Initial claim on old account ending in XXXX is XXXX.\"\\nXX/XX/2019 I applied for the XXXX  credit card in the Chase Credit Card website and be approved one month ago. I have yet received my credit card. I call the customer service of the Chase Credit Card company and they transfer my call to many many departments. The call lasted for almost one hour. But, none of them can answer why I can not get my card and how I can get my card. This severely influence my life because I was waiting for the card for emergent purchase.\\nI currently have a fifth third secure credit card. I couldnt enroll in auto payment online so I applied via mail. I sumbitted my first form of auto payments during the beginning of XXXX and still havent gotten auto payments yet and its already mid late XXXX. I didnt want to get charged a late fee so i called towards the end of XXXX to reassure if I was already enrolled in auto payments yet and the customer service reassured me i was already enroll and that it will withdraw from my bank account on XXXX XXXX so I didnt have to set up a payment. XXXX XXXX comes around and i recieved a call stating i have missed a payment and charged a fee. I called up to fifth third customer service and the lady told me i was not enroll onto auto and that she couldnt help with my problem so she gave me a number to call back to see way i wasnt enrolled in auto payment. I do not recommend this credit card or bank at all very unprofessional and do not value you as a customer.\\n\"XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX *received a text message from XXXX asking me if I tried to charge {$1300.00} at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, Fl. Told me to press 1 for yes and 2 for no. I pressed 2 to decline it. I was in XXXX XXXX, TX with my card in my wallet, not in FL. I then immediately checked my account and had {$0.00} balance when earlier that day I had {$1400.00} and some change.

I had NEVER called to change any of my information before, NEVER. She told me it showed I had called in a few days before the XXXX and requested that my email and mailing address be changed and updated, BUT, she would not tell me what it had been changed to, so I have absolutely no idea what they had on file for me. I gave her my correct info, changed my security question answer, password to my account and also my PIN number. She sent me an email with a reference number to refer to for future calls. After we got all of that sorted out ... \\n\\n* I told her about the text message and me declining the transaction and then seeing the 4 pending purchases. I asked her if she could stop them and she said she couldnt do anything until they either fall off or clear. She said I couldnt even file a claim until they were out of the pending which depends on the merchants time frame of processing. She said I could contact the stores and ask for info on the transactions and see if they could reverse the charges. I still to this day have no idea how this happened since I still have my card in my possession. \\n\\n* I hung up with her agreeing that something definitely was going on with my account and felt reassured that I would be taken care of. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX, XXXX * I looked up the phone numbers for the stores and contacted them all, receiving no help in stopping the charges. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX, XXXX * the first purchase clears and listed as a completed transaction on my account.

They take all the information listed above and tell me they will email me in 1-2 days with an attachment to fill out a Declaration of Fraud form and that I needed to submit it within 10 business days of that day,  the XXXX. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX, XXXX * I received the email with the Declaration of Fraud form XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX * I upload and send in the Declaration of Fraud form Form with attachments of proof that I declined the transactions and proof that I was in TX when the purchases were in FL. \\n\\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I called several times to check the status of my case. They told me I had to wait 10 business days. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX, XXXX * I receive and email stating my claim had been denied based on the information provided, they found that no error or fraud had occurred. \\n* I immediately called the fraud department, question them up and and down and re-opened the case. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX, XXXX * case is re-opened XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX * I receive the Declaration of Fraud form and fill it out again XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX * I upload my filled out Declaration of Fraud form and again attach a screen shot of the text message showing I chose option 2 to decline transactions, I also gave verification of my location at the time of the transactions, provided through my employer. I offered anything else they may need in order to verify but of course never contacted me or asked for anything. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX, XXXX * received an email informing me that my claim had been denied again and case was closed. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX, XXXX * after receiving the email I immediately called and asked to speak with a supervisor. I explained to him what had happened, that this was my second claim that had been denied ... I asked him with all the proof I provided, how was it possible that it could be denied. He said I had to write a hand written letter and mail it to receive that information. So I asked him, why were the charges allowed to be approved and processed when I chose option 2 in the fraud alert text I received that day. His response was, on our end it shows you approved them WHAT? I told him I sent a screenshot of the text and I clearly chose option 2 to decline the transactions. He said the transactions had already been made earlier before that text was sent. So Confusing! What is the point in sending an alert if its too late or if it doesnt matter what option the customer chooses ... he had no answer for me. Also, how in the world did they receive the info on their end that I had approved the transaction when I clearly declined it? Why did I only get a text for the {$1300.00} purchase at XXXX and not the other 3 transactions? No answers. He said I would have to speak with a different department for that so I asked him to transfer me, he then told me there is not a direct line to that department, so I asked him how was I supposed to speak with them, he said write a letter with your info, mail it and someone will contact you. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XX/XX/2019 * I requested for the case to AGAIN, be re-opened, sent in the Declaration of Fraud form with proof, waiting for 10 business days for their decision.\"\\nI had 3 store credit cards where Synchrony Bank was the bank. An Amazon Store Card, Guitar Center Card, and a Lowes card. All cards were paid and never late. All cards had {$0.00} balances. My credit report does not have any late payments. In the last couple weeks, Synchrony has closed at least 2 of these accounts without notice.\\nThis particular account situation that is lately filing on my own credit document has a seriously unfavorable relation to my personal ability to obtain a present loan application.

Moreconfirmation of the aforesaid item too. My proper request mustover, I was never 30 days/60 days/120 days late in any of my payments and I\\'m not greatly tuned in to the date opened so I prefer to ask your be investigated as soon as possible and confirmed to be correct. Thanks!\\n\"I have a visa card w/wells fargo that I have been intently trying to pay down. I have been making automatic payments of {$140.00} every 2 weeks to them. I have 2 promotional zero percent balances with them. Presently, as of my XXXX statement it is as follows : {$2300.00} 0 % till XX/XX/20 {$8200.00} 0 % till XX/XX/20 When I make payments, Wells Fargo, unfairly credits more towards one balance then the other -- making it essentially impossible to pay off the 1st promotional balance before the expiration date. For example, I was told when they receive the first {$140.00} payment they distribute as follows : {$32.00} goes towards the {$2300.00} {$110.00} goes towards the {$8200.00} Why aren\\'t they distributing the {$140.00} ( x2 ) evenly to each balance? I feel that puts me at a disadvantage, afterall it is the same interest rate for each balance. \\n\\nI called wells fargo, explained that my goal was to target & paydown these debts & I wanted to make a {$1000.00} payment to go solely to the {$2300.00} balance & they said that I couldn\\'t. I spoke w/3 people & the last person said he would file a complaint & someone from Case Mgt would get back w/me. I did this just today, so I expect they will be following up w/me, but based on the fact that I had to talk to 3 different people and file a complaint, it appears this is their practice and I feel a complaint is warranted regardless, even if my issue with them directly is handled satisfactorily. \\n\\nI feel this is unfair credit/banking practices because I have been paying more than the minimum owed, I don\\'t understand why I can\\'t direct my payments where I want them to go ( I can do this on my mortgage for example, and make extra payments & direct them to my principal ). \\n\\nThe only resolution I was provided was that I would have to wait till the 1st promotion ended and then I would have a window where I could pay that balance in full w/in the billing cycle before the higher interest rate started accruing, but that doesn\\'t seem fair. I want to make a payment today of $ XXXX, and next month of $ XXXX, to target that balance and attempt to zero it out before XX/XX/20 and I feel I have the right to do that but wells fargo says that I can not.', 'On XX/XX/XXXX I called and spoke with a member of their team known as XXXX I asked for my account to be closed and he stated a confirmation letter would be sent to my current address.

I ran a credit report through each of the credit bureaus and each of them showed the Kohls account status as consumer deceased. \\n\\nI called and spoke to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and he had me go to a local Kohls store to prove I was very much alive. I show two forms of ID and they said within 30 to 60 days they would remove it from my credit report that they had missed keyed their entry.

At no time have I asked Kohls to re-open my card I am simply asking them to correct their error in keying my credit report as a deceased consumer. When I called on XX/XX/XXXX again I got the same answers of they hadnt started yet but that I would get a letter as soon as they had. \\n\\nI have filed a dispute with each individual credit report all of which have returned to me having corrected the deceased portion however today I spoke with XXXX and they stated that Kohls was still reporting me as deceased and though they can fix it internally until Kohls fixes that my credit report will remain troubled.

In the past, the company had authorized increase spend amounts if I called in and told them the upcoming amounts. This time, they told me they could not do that because my balance was high ( albeit all of my payments had been made and I paid the minimum amount due ). I was told the only way they would authorize future charges is if I made a pre-payment of {$18000.00} on the card. This completely contradicts the real value prop of the card, as it does nothing to help my cash flow, and has put me in a real bind. \\n\\nI hold Amex to a higher standard because they created a holiday to support small businesses ( great marketing ).

On XX/XX/18, a Home Depot Salesperson, XXXX XXXX, signed us up for two home improvement projects ( new rain gutters and a new sliding-glass door/window ). He never provided us receipts for these services nor has Home Depot or their installers, so we have no way of comparing prices to what we see on our Home Depot credit card statement.\\n\\n2. Also onXX/XX/18 Mr. XXXX called up Home Depot \\'s Consumer Credit telephone line and signed us up for a Home Depot credit card promising us a 2-year interest-free promotion. He initialed our Consumer Credit Application \"\" XXXX XX/XX/18 \\'\\' and the telephone representative confirmed the 2-year interest-free promotion on these home improvement projects, repeating various times that our call was being recorded for \"\" quality assurance. \\'\\' 3. It took many weary, frustrating months to get Home Depot to schedule the installations of these projects, but they were finally complete just before XXXX  in mid-XX/XX/XXXX ( over 3 months after Mr. XXXX \\'s sales visit ). Again, we never received receipts or invoices for these repair projects, so we simply have to \"\" trust \\'\\' that our bill is correct. However, the initial bills did NOT honor the promotional 2-years interest-free rate promised us by the salesperson Mr. XXXX, by the telephone consumer credit representative at the time we signed the agreements and application, and even by the Home Depot scheduler over the months it took to get the projects installed.\\n\\n4. I wrote several complaints about the billing statements not honoring the 2-year interest-free promotional rate without resolution. It appeared a robot was responding to my complaints. I finally had to call the so-called \"\" Consumer Care \\'\\' line during \"\" business hours \\'\\' ( difficult for a full-time working mom/XXXX  ) to resolve the issue, as my bill said it would start accruing interest as ofXX/XX/XXXX ( i.e., 6 months interest-free, not the 24 months that I was quoted at the time of sale and application as well as repeated in calls with the Home Depot scheduler ).\\n\\n5. Today,XX/XX/XXXX, I sat down to pay my bill that is due in XX/XX/XXXX, and I see that I have acquired a surprise interest charge of {$2.00}. No, it\\'s not a lot, but it is a sneaky fee that makes me again doubt the business practices of this company that has offered my 24-months interest free. I further noticed that this is the first billing statement that warns me of a \"\" revolving balance \\'\\' that can accrue interest. However, this information is buried on page 3 near the end of the statement, i.e., buried beneath all of this information : Summary, Payment Information, Promotional Balances, Advertisements for gift cards, Billing Coupon, Information About Your Account, Key Credit Terms, Change of Address Form, Another Advertisement for Nest, etc.\\n\\n6. I have never seen a more confusing billing statement, and I have several credit cards and am vigilant about my credit, my debt, and my bills. For example, I have an XXXX XXXX Citi Master Card, a XXXX XXXX American Express Card, and a XXXX XXXX XXXX Visa Card. None of these billing statements from other companies have deceived me. I am confident in accusing Home Depot \\'s consumer credit card with deceptive business practices. In addition to not honoring quoted promotions, the billing statement buries fees and is difficult to read. It frequently has mistakes and it does not explain what the date or nature of each purchase. Instead of clearly marking a date and citing the transaction with something like HVAC service or window installation, window materials, or window down payment, etc. ; the bill simply lists as follows : \"\" Revolving Balance NO INT FOR 24MOS-PMT REQ NO INT FOR 24MOS-PMT REQ NO INT FOR 24MOS-PMT REQ NO INT FOR 24MOS-PMT REQ. \\'\\' 7. To make matters worse, Home Depot and their service providers have provided no receipts for these services, so I have no way of comparing my billing statement to my receipts or invoices. In other words, I am at the mercy of Home Depot \\'s supposed honor system here, when I have already discovered various mistakes and problems with my bill.\\n\\n8. It blows my mind that this company has such deceptive and incompetent business practices, and I would NEVER recommend this card to anyone else. I am tempted to just pay it off in full before the 24-month promotion ends in order to not accrue any more headaches with this company, but I do have other home improvement projects that I need to spend my available funds on.\"\\non XXXX my cc was billed for 2 separate transactions with XXXX. one for XXXX and another for XXXX we notified XX/XX/XXXX to not charge my card as my employer would be paying for this joint advertising. it was to late XX/XX/XXXX charged my card. my company sent a ck for the XXXX account to our XXXX XXXX partner for our half of the advertisement.

I always paid my balance off, and was not charged any interest.This card required that I spend $XXXX within the first 3 months of card membership in order to receive the sign up bonus of XXXX points. I met this requirement and I could see the bonus points as pending on my credit card statement.Then I received a notice that my account was being closed and that my points were being forfeited, and that I could not longer use the card.  The reason state was a pattern of buying gift cards.  I tried to see if I could get my account reinstated with no success. When I could not get my card reinstated I requested that the annual fee be refunded to me since I paid the $XXXX  fee. This request was refused. I requested that the annual fee be prorated for the months that I was not able to use it, this was also refused.I was wronged first that I clearly met the terms of the sign up bonus, I saw the points as pending to my rewards account, but then US Bank frozen my account not allowing me to use the points.

Being deprived of it has caused me financial harm in many ways, such that I am deprived of the 4 % rewards on my future purchases. It has also financially, negatively impacted my FICA score because the credit card company cancelled my card. I originally applied for the card in late XX/XX/XXXX, it negatively impacts my ability to get credit until late XX/XX/XXXX ( 24 months ).

I IMMEDIATELY called HSBC and notified them that these charges were fraudulent. I also called XXXX and they confirmed that the accounts did not match any information on my legitimate XXXX account and were considered fraudulent charges. I also notified HSBC of this determination by XXXX. The HSBC representative told me to submit in writing the charges I was disputing and if they could not determine them to be fraudulent, they would charge me interest on the charges, which I would be expected to pay. \\n\\nI made a spreadsheet of the disputed charges, with dates and transaction numbers and sent that information to HSBC at the address they provided to me. I also paid the legitimate charges on the account and immediately stopped using the account. HSBC closed the account and issued new cards, which I have never used. \\n\\nThe statement received the next month ( ( XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX ) showed all charges had been cleared and they determined they owed me an additional {$540.00}. I requested that amount to be refunded to me and planned to close the card account. The next statement showed the {$540.00} refund and a balance of {$0.00}. The NEXT statement, dated XX/XX/XXXX, showed that three of the disputed and previously settled charges had once again been charged to my account and that I now owed {$1500.00}!! I immediately AGAIN contacted HSBC, talked with three people over the course of an hour and they now say they will \"\" look into the matter \\'\\' but that I owe them this money, plus any interest accrued while they \"\" try \\'\\' to settle this case. \\n\\nI DID manage to cancel the credit card during the course of these conversations, but still have had no word as to how their internal bookkeeping can not seem to settle this case.

My cards were used while I was at an adult establishment and charged for outrageous amounts with outrageous gratuity amounts added on to the purchases without my authorization. A police report was filed against the merchant and an affidavit stating I did not authorize those purchase and the handwriting on the receipts are forged were submitted to American Express as evidence. The total in charges on two of my american express cards was over {$70000.00}. On multiple occasions the American Express fraud team told me in writing that the fraud case for these charges was closed in my favor and I would not be responsible for any of the charges. However, out of the over {$70000.00} in fraudulent charges American express only credited my account {$13000.00} and now states that I will be responsible for the remaining balance. American Express states that because I was present at the time the cards were being used it can not be considered fraud which is contradictory to Florida Statute 817.61, which states \"\" A person who, with intent to defraud the issuer or a person or organization providing money, goods, services, or anything else of value or any other person, uses, for the purpose of obtaining money, goods, services, or anything else of value, a credit card obtained or retained in violation of this part or a credit card which he or she knows is forged, or who obtains money, goods, services, or anything else of value by representing, without the consent of the cardholder, that he or she is the holder of a specified card or by representing that he or she is the holder of a card and such card has not in fact been issued violates this section. \\'\\' Nowhere in the statute does it say that the cardholder must not be present for fraud to occur. The fact that the charges were made without my knowledge and the receipts were forged is more than sufficient for these charges to be considered as fraud. In addition to the fact that these receipts were forged, all of the charges occurred after the legal operating hours for an adult establishment in XXXX XXXX County and documentation of such was also provided to American Express.', 'Synchrony Networks C/o XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, FL XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX This company has fraudulently charged me with nonsense fees and late charges. \\nI had been paying the installments every month regularly and have already paid more than the principal amount. \\nAfter closing the account they still keep fraudulently charging the fees. \\nThis needs to be stopped.', 'This complaint is about the Bluebird by American Express prepaid card.

I attempted to take back the broken item to XXXX 's and they refused to take it back stating that I needed to take it up with the manufacturer. Which is why I opened the dispute. I noticed that neither one of the companies supplied any information or evidence contradicting what I said. All they showed Citibank was copies of the register receipts. That does not negate what I've been saying all along and clearly does not constitute allegations of dishonesty. Clearly, Citibank is defaming my character and credibility, which I intend to take action against. \\n\\nAlso, as of XX/XX/2019, I have never been supplied with any terms and conditions agreement, as Citibank claims that they have complied with. I now ask that they please provide a SIGNED copy of the terms and conditions with my signature on it. Absent that piece of evidence, they have no legal right to withhold my earned rewards. \\n\\nCitibank has to understand that just because something is written in a document does not mean it is legal. Thus, I'm contesting the legality of their terms and conditions, even though I have never seen the term and conditions agreement. \\n\\nI plan on filing complaints with multiple agencies and the possibly seeking legal action to recover the {$120.00} plus the {$64.00} that they have illegally taken from me with no justifiable explanation other than that fact that I forfeited the rewards when they canceled my credit card. Citibank has to understand that they've never shown me any proof that the terms and conditions state this fact and they've never show me any proof that this is legal. At this time, I also reserving the right to file a civil complaint for discrimination, defamation of character and liable. \\n\\nAll this can be rectified if Citbank just issues the rewards that I have earned. I guarantee that if I file a civil complaint for discrimination, defamation of character and liable, that the legal fees for Citibank will far exceed the {$120.00} and {$64.00}.\", 'Comenity, the credit card issuer of XXXX MasterCard,  assessed late fee charge to my account, however I believe it was done without merit. I contacted the Comenity via email and phone contesting that late fee, but bank insisted I still owe the late fee, so I decided to file a complaint against the card issuer practices of assessing the late fees. \\n\\nThe facts : 1. Billing statement for XX/XX/XXXX displayed balance of {$170.00} with payment due date XX/XX/XXXX. That particular billing statement displayed a Late Fee Warning : If we do not RECEIVE your minimum payment by XX/XX/XXXX you may have to pay up to a {$39.00} late fee. Via on line cervices of my bank, on XX/XX/XXXX I created bill payment for {$170.00}, to be delivered on XX/XX/XXXX, one day before due date.Based on my bank \\'s bill payment history details, my bank processed my order on XX/XX/XXXX and issued a check for {$170.00}. My Bank mailed the check on XX/XX/XXXX and DELIVERED it to Comenity on XX/XX/XXXX, one day before due date. \\n\\n2. Next Billing statement for XX/XX/XXXX displayed {$32.00} as a total fees charged ( {$30.00} late fee plus {$2.00} interest charges on purchases ). That statement displays the following : Transaction Date : XX/XX/XXXX Payment - Thank You, - {$170.00}. XXXX. I was surprised to see the late fee charges because, based on my Bank history, I paid balance of {$170.00} on time, one day before the due date ( XX/XX/XXXX ). \\n\\n3. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX, via on line Comentity services, I sent email asking to credit {$32.00} to my account. I included the copy of the history of that particular payment from my Bank, proving that my bank DELIVERED the check on time. Within 48 hours I got information that I still owe {$32.00} late fee, because, Comenity POSTED the payment on XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\n4. On XXXX XXXX I followed up and spoke with Comenity Representative, trying to resolve, what I felt, was the issue of unlawful assessment of late fee. This Representative admitted that Comenity POSTED my payment of {$170.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. However, was not able to prove when the payment was RECEIVED. Representative stated that, based on the Comenity standards, POSTING date equals RECEIVING date. I contested that on the ground, that the paper billing statement does not provide the definition of receiving, and, or posting dates. Actually, the term \"\" posting \\'\\' is not mentioned at all in the Late payment warning statement. \\n\\n5. I paid the {$32.00} late fee charges on XX/XX/XXXX to avoid additional late fee charges. However, I still feel that Comenity practices are very deceitful. I sent Comenity profs from my bank that payment was DELIVERED on time ( one day before the due date ), but still was faced with the late fee/interest charges. \\nIt appears to me that Comenity did not POSTED my payment on time, after RECEIVING the check on time, on XX/XX/XXXX. That is the reason I feel the late fee assessment is not justified. \\n\\n6. I will attach the correspondence I exchanged with Comenity in step 3.', 'XX/XX/19 at XXXX I placed an online order with XXXX using my Citibank credit card. When I attempted to personalize the order, I found that their program was not as described, and that I would need to purchase additional food. I canceled the order on the merchant \\'s website. I received a confirmation email from the merchant at XXXX XX/XX/19 that this order had been canceled. \\n\\nWhen the order appeared on my credit card account, I filed a dispute with Citibank. Within my dispute I identified that the product was not as described ( NOT a full meal replacement program ) and I stated that the order had been canceled within hours of having been initiated. \\n\\nCitibank apparently only notified the merchant of the \"\" goods/services not as expected \\'\\' portion of my dispute and did not include that the order had been canceled in their contact with the merchant. \\n\\nXX/XX/19 I discovered that Citibank had marked this dispute \"\" resolved \\'\\'. I contacted Citibank and spoke with their dispute clerks who refused to reopen this dispute. The clerk stated that on XX/XX/19 Citibank sent me a notice to the messaging center within Citibank \\'s website, but this clerk admitted that Citibank never emailed me, called me or sent me a letter. He told me that I, as a customer, am expected to \"\" check the messaging center every day \\'\\' in the event Citibank has sent me a notice. I find this ridiculous. \\n\\nCitibank failed to properly adjudicate this dispute. I have documentation to verify that this order was canceled within hours of being placed.

So, I chat with amex and they assured me that their institution won\\'t try to pull the payment but still they did next day back to back two times. Then I called amex again and discuss about it for half an hour and they were trying to manipulate.

Also, I remarried and changed my name legally in XXXX.\\n\"I was out of the country on business from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. When I return to the U.S. I received a mailed letter from Bank of America that my 2 ( a business and personal credit card ) credit card accounts were closed. I was shocked and didn\\'t understand why. Before leaving for my business trip, I made sure both accounts had a zero balance and was in good standing. I called Bank of America the next day after arriving back in the U.S. and was not given any specific reasons as to why the credit card accounts were closed. I also stopped into a local branch to see if there was any additional information on why the accounts were closed and they were not helpful either. My personal XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX credit card miles for.. \\n\\nHere are reasons why I believe my accounts should be reactivated/unfrozen : 1 ) Investments - I have money to invest and currently have my money at other competing financial firms in a couple of separate wealth management accounts. I have a good friend that retired from XXXX XXXX in the and we have spoke about investing some of my money with Bank of America/XXXX XXXX. Before leaving for my business trip overseas, I inquired about a private client relationship with XXXX XXXX. \\n\\n2 ) Rewards - I believe that Bank of America has not sent XXXX   XXXX XXXX earned through spend on my business card ( ending in XXXX ) to XXXX XXXX on my most recent statement during which my account was closed. I believe those miles add up to somewhere between 5,000 to 30,000 miles. Bank of America did send miles to my personal card but has not done so with my Business ( XXXX ) card. \\n\\n3 ) History - I have been a XXXX customer for the past 5 years or so with a great history of on time payments and my accounts have all been in good standing. \\n\\n4 ) Business spending - I have formally registered business registered with the state of Minnesota, with a federal tax ID number. All of the ( large ) spending on my Bank of America credit cards is directly connected to my business. I do value rewards, especially when I need to travel overseas for work, and the cards help me to earn rewards. I have significant business travel planned in XXXX and XXXX and would like to continue and further my banking relationships with Bank of America. \\n\\n5 ) Annual Fees - I had planned to renew both of my ( 2 ) Bank of America credit cards for the foreseeable future. I value my relationship with Bank of America for various reasons. I plan to continue my relationship and hopefully expand it in the future, but this closure/freeze is frustrating and confusing. \\n\\n6 ) Legal & Social Media - I haven\\'t written, blogged, posted on XXXX, XXXX, or used other media outlets to publicize this situation, for which I believe that I\\'ve been misjudged for some unknown reason. I have spoken with a local attorney who has handled similar issues and related cases, but hope those rather negative options are avoidable. \\n\\n7 ) Credit - my credit score is around 770 and has been managed well for years. My credit and banking relationships are extremely important to me. \\n\\n8 ) Family - I am starting a family in the next few months and our family needs a good bank and credit cards that will serve us well. We will have increased spending on many items in many stores.', 'capital one keeps reporting negative remarks on my accounts to the credit bureaus. They keep saying that I initiated a dispute, investigation completed, and consumer disagrees and this is simply not the truth. \\n\\nMy two capital one accounts are closed. At one point the payments were late but never missed as I always paid something. I closed these accounts and enrolled them into a debt management company so that Capital One would be paid. I could have walked away from the debt but did not do so. But Capital one says that I have disputed my accounts and that is not true. The only thing I have ever disputed are these false, misleading remarks that they keep placing on my credit files. \\n\\nI am trying to get a mortgage and this is impacting my ability to do so. Why must capital one do this to me? Are they upset that the interest rate got reduced when I submitted my two accounts to be handled by this debt management company? Are they not happy that the accounts are being paid on time each month? \\n\\nWhy are they intentionally trying to hurt me by posting these remarks that are not true on my credit reports. They are intentionally trying to get me turned down for a mortgage for my family. I have asked them in the past to stop this, they called me and said that all remarks would be removed but this was a lie. I am filing this complaint to have the CFPB help me. I am attaching a copy of the credit report to show proof of their unprofessional conduct. My next step is to file a State Attorney Generals complaint against them if they refuse to honor my request.\\n\\nThey are intentionally reporting these false, derogatory remarks on all 3 credit bureau reports and it needs to stop. This is getting out of hand that they are doing this to me.\\n\\nI could simply stop paying them and let the debt go into a write off status for them and not let them get one single dime moving forward but I do not want to do that but they are leaving me no choice.

After all, If I sign up the promotional financing instead of the reduced price on the item purchased, I\\'m obviously planning it out to pay all of the financed amount off in a 12 month or less period. Comenity didn\\'t have a recurring payment option until recently. I believe this was intentional on their part and the retailers. The customer chooses to pay the higher sticker price to get the reduced financing charges. The finance company then makes it impossible to set up recurring payments and in turn its a double dip. \\n\\nThe reason for this email is I was dealing with a parent in hospice from XX/XX/XXXX -  XX/XX/XXXX and I did not know that my promotional period was ending. So when I made a payment it was too late and I got whacked for {$770.00} worth of finance charges. When I asked them to remove this and explain my situation in a calm manner they said NO. This is a disgusting business practice and Im sure it has happened many times over. \\n\\nThank you, XXXX XXXX', 'Today, on XX/XX/XXXX I accessed my online account to pay my credit card balance and I noticed a recent charge, which stood out to me since I haven\\'t utilized the card for weeks while self-quarantining for Covid-19. It was a \"\" Rewards Annual Membership Fee. \\'\\' I didn\\'t recognize this charge so I tried to access the information about where it came from, but no details were provided on the link -- which is not typical. Most vendors provide a phone number at the very minimum. Suspecting fraud I called card services right away. When I asked the representative to find me a contact number for that entity he laughed and said that it was Wells Fargo. This was the first time I heard of any Rewards associated with this credit card. This representative told me that he had to \\'erase \\' all of the points that he said I had earned ( apparently 13K+ ), stating that it was the only way that he could proceed in resolving this dispute as he couldn\\'t get past that window without me agreeing to let him delete the points. I told him that I was fine with that so long as all charges, current and past, were credited back to me. I then asked him to go back and see how many times over the past several years I had been charged. After waiting on hold he returned to the line and said that there had been no previous charges. By this point I had started going through my tax files and found statements from XXXX and XXXX, each showing a {$50.00} awards membership charge. He then transferred me to someone in \"\" customer care. \\'\\' This person started the conversation by saying that I had accessed my rewards. I informed her that this was definitely not the case as I had no knowledge of said rewards until today and that the only person who accessed them was the representative I had first spoken to who deleted all of the points. \\n\\nI spent an hour and a half trying to get this issue resolved. At the time that I opened this account there was no mention of any rewards program or any annual fee associated with this account. It may have been hidden somewhere in the fine print, but I guarantee you that as part of the conversation with the banker I would have insisted on reassurance that there were no annual fees associated with the card. This credit card was going to be dedicated to a small business with low volume purchases ( low reward opportunity ) and I would NEVER have agreed to pay an annual fee -- nor would I have failed to ask if there was an annual fee for the card. I have great credit and I can obtain a credit card from any company that I want -- I would NOT have agreed to a fee. I\\'m submitting this complaint because it seems reasonable to assume that I\\'m not the only person who has experienced this problem. All in all it appears that at the very minimum they\\'ve fraudulently charged my account {$200.00}. I am insisting on FULL reimbursement for every charge, seeing as I\\'ve never accessed said rewards and had no knowledge until today of said rewards. I\\'m told that my case ( # XXXX ) has been moved up to \"\" Case Management \\'\\' at Wells Fargo. They gave me a direct access number of XXXX. Though I have been verbally assured that the most recent charge of {$50.00} has been removed, there is not evidence of this credit on my online account as of yet.\"\\nI requested payment assistance in form of fee waiver via a secure message on Barclaycardus.com, message sent several days ago ... Payment assistance is needed due to pandemic, a fee waiver was requested and no reply to date. I also called Barclaycard several times, was on hold for well over two hours each time and no rep picked up. Calls were made to again request fee waiver as well as payment assistance in form of extension or deferral. The fee in question will remain unpaid as I am disputing it, account will be paid off less the amount. Being such a small amount, {$15.00}, if any collection agency even accepts the account, I doubt they will attempt to collect after explained the amount is questionable due to pandemic and other reasons. Prior complaints were made via CFPB portal, a XXXX marks them as duplicate in order to avoid refunding fee and or offering assistance. The fee is for NSF, a payment returned on XX/XX/XXXX, unbeknown to me, Barclay resubmits payments, if I had known this I would not have made a replacement payment on XXXX which did in fact clear on XX/XX/XXXX as attached screen shot shows..\\nI have been attempting to resolve an issue since XXXX with Lowes Credit Services managed by Syncrony Bank. Lowes Credit Services auto pay system erroneously double drafted my account on XXXX which prompted my bank to flag the payment and decline it. I submitted an inquiry to Lowes and made multiple phone calls immediately after receiving notification of the issue beginning on XXXX. I also, in good faith, submitted payment manually to Lowes while Lowes worked through the issue. I submitted a follow up response as my request to correct the issue was denied and my account was closed immediately without warning. After learning that Lowes closed my account and did not provide a plausible explanation, I submitted a follow up response on XXXX and provided multiple documents to provide evidence of my claim which included a letter from my banking institution. After supplying the evidence, On XXXX I received communication from Lowes that stated I would receive a response within 60 days. On XX/XX/19, I learned that my credit score dropped due to the negative reporting from Lowes. On XX/XX/19, I escalated the matter with Lowes and was advised by Lowes that I would receive a response within 7-14 days. To date, I have not received a response, my account remains closed and my credit report has not been corrected. I would employ the CFPB to investigate Lowes for unfair credit practices. Very much appreciate the assistance.\\n\"On XX/XX/2019 at approx. XXXX CST I spole with XXXX XXXX, a representative with US Bank. I was inquiring about the US Bank Visa Signature Rewards credit card. Card holders are allowed to choose two categories in which the cash back rewards for the quarter are 5%. The online information indicated \"\"groceries\"\" was one such category. I asked Ms. XXXX  if I could choose groceries every quarter, and she replied in the affirmative. I asked if there was a cap on the rewards, and she  replied that there is not.Wanting to further make sure that the card would meet the needs of my family, I asked (paraphrasing) \"\"What if i charge $XXXX on groceries every month, would I get 5% back on the entire $XXXX in charges?\"\" Ms. XXXX again replied in the affirmative.    Today, upon receipt of the credit cards (one in my name, one in  my wife\\'s name), I went on line to choose \"\"groceries\"\" as one of my two 5% back categories. I was shocked to see that if i choose \"\"groceries\"\" that I would only receive 2% back!!!I called the US Bank phone number today, XX/XX/XXXX at approx. XXXX   XXXX CST. The first rep I spoke with said there was nothing that could be done. I asked to speak to her supervisor. I was connected with and spoke to, XXXX, also told me there was nothing to be done. I asked to speak with XXXX supervisor, and he told me that a manager will call me within 24 hours.A representative of US Bank lied to me.

I have been working on this for the last two months. Finally after having spoken with multiple supervisors in the customer service department, our company was sent the two credit cards for which we applied. The cards were receied in the mail and we were told that they are open to all expenses but then 4 hours later we received an email saying that we weren\\'t approved and the cards were locked from our account.

We never submitted a second application. We called to have the problem that customer service caused fixed, but that never happened.

I asked that they provide me their own computations to arrive at the interest amount they are charging me for each statement. Citi has been computing interests incorrectly causing for them to overcharge customers accounts. \\n\\nFor instance, based on the 15.24 % interest rate on my account, I should only have been billed {$99.00} interest instead of {$100.00} shown on my statement for billing periods XX/XX/19 thru XX/XX/19. On this statement, I was overcharged {$3.00}. For billing periods XX/XX/19 thru XX/XX/19, I was overcharged {$3.00}. Citi has been overcharging interests by at least {$3.00} each statement. One obvious reason I noticed that Citi intends to defraud consumers is when the interest amounts goes up  while account balances goes down. For instance, my ending balance for periods XX/XX/19thruXX/XX/XXXXXX/XX/19 was {$7800.00}, but I was charged {$96.00} of interests. However, I was charged {$100.00} of interest for billing periods XX/XX/19 through XX/XX/19 when my account balance was only {$7600.00}. I have attached a copy of an XXXX worksheet showing them how I arrived at the interest amounts I am claiming. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/2019, I received a response from their customer service with a post office box address of XXXX.

I believe Citi cards deceive and discriminate against XXXX cardholders. Because we are XXXX cardholders, Citibank Cards do whatever they like to make false statements to continue debiting our bank accounts, took our money from our bank account. \\n\\n2. And also from the last statement I received from Citi Card, I  did not see Macys transition statement from my account that is deception and false and fraud statement.', \"I have been trying to resolve an issue with Wells Fargo regarding charges to my credit card related to unauthorized transfers resulting in fees they assessed. These transfers, which resulted in a {$12.00} charge to my credit card was not done by me. They were either done by an employee within the Wells Fargo organization or done as the result of an error on the part of Wells Fargo 's banking systems, which happens often with this financial institution. However, they are now trying to force me to be responsible for paying these unauthorized charges ( fees ) in the amount of {$12.00} which is indeed fraudulent in nature. I have spoken to several representatives since XX/XX/2019 and to no avail have not gotten any satisfaction. They actually refunded half of the fraudulent fees, but left the remaining {$12.00} charged to my card. How is it that they would refund half of the unauthorized charges/fees, but leave the other half on my card? It doesn't make sense and no one within their organization can answer that question. They refuse to allow me to dispute this charge online via my portal so as to continue to assess fees to the card because I refuse to pay their fraudulent charges. \\n\\nI never authorized Wells Fargo to use a credit card account as a line of protection for any other accounts I've had with them over the years. This was something Wells Fargo did on their own. I never gave them permission to use this card for that purpose, however, they've done it and that in itself is fraudulent. For this reason, as well as my dissatisfaction with this bank for allowing this problem to go unresolved for 3 months, and other issues, I have closed ALL of my accounts. I believe their inaction in handling this matter is retaliation for me doing so. They are a scam and defraud customers to generate fee income on their products and services. I have been trying to get this issue of {$12.00} resolved since XX/XX/2019, and yet, I get nothing but the run-around with this institution. As a consumer, I will not be forced to pay for unauthorized charges or fees to a credit card or deposit account. For a bank like Wells Fargo to continue such an issue over {$12.00} is ridiculous. I want this matter resolved so I can be done with Wells Fargo indefinitely.

On XX/XX/XXXX I placed an online order that totaled {$1600.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX I checked to see how much my payment due was and the available credit reflected I was negative {$670.00}. I immediately called the bank to figure out how my account was over the limit and my credit line was increased. I was told by XXXX that my last purchase caused the account to be over the limit and the credit line was only increased to {$4000.00}, but we could not understand how the transaction got approved. XXXX tried to increase my credit to cover the {$670.00} but I was denied and was told to contact JCP.com. On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with XXXX at JCP.com and was told my transaction got approved because they took the system offline and transactions can go through during that time even if the customer does not have the credit available.

Then we signed a second contract on XX/XX/2019 to install a sliding glass door. We needed to remodel our kitchen, due to water damage. We told the contractor that we were waiting on the money from my home owners insurance, and that there might be a delay in starting the job. The owner of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, offered us a finance option to pay through XXXX financial. XXXX said that we wouldn\\'t have to put a down payment, no interest, and no payments for 18 months. I applied, and was approved for {$25000.00} dollars. XXXX advised us that, he couldn\\'t charge the account until the job was complete. He said he would do a walk through, and at that point if were satisfied. That we would sign a authorization form, giving him permission to charge the account. We agreed to proceed with the job. Before starting the kitchen, XXXX ordered an XXXX XXXX door. It took about 2 1/2 weeks, and we set an appointment to install the door on XX/XX/2019. His crew did not show up on Friday XX/XX/2019, nor did we receive any phone calls for the no show. We called XXXX, and he told us it was a communication error. He said he was firing the crew, and sending out another one on Saturday XX/XX/2019. The new crew came out on XX/XX/2019, and installed the door. We noticed the door that was installed, was not one we had ordered, and it was a less expensive door. We confronted XXXX over the phone, and sent him pictures on XX/XX/2019 of the door labels the workers had throw away in our trash can. The labels indicated that, the door was a cheaper XXXX XXXX door, not a XXXX door in which we had ordered. We advised XXXX that we wanted to cancel both of the contracts. XXXX said that, it was a human error. And that, he would charge us a 25 % cancelation fee, and put a lien on the property if we cancelled the contracts. We told XXXX to go ahead and proceed, and that we would contact the XXXX, XXXX, and post our experience on XXXX. He asked what he could do to resolve this, and if he could order the right XXXX door and install it. We agreed to let him order and install the right door and pay him cash, if he let us out of the contracts without charging us the 25 % cancelation fee. We all agreed, and the new door was ordered. While we were waiting for the new door to come in, we received an email from XXXX financial on XX/XX/2019 that the account had been charged {$21000.00} that morning. We contacted XXXX that same day XX/XX/2019, and reported that this was fraud. We indicated that, our contractor charged the account without my authorization. XXXX not only chared the account the total amount of both contracts which equal {$16000.00}. But also charged an overage charge of {$5100.00} dollars, which totals {$21000.00} dollars.They said that they would investigate our claim, and contact the contractor to try to resolve this matter. A XXXX representative named XXXX, informed us that if XXXX does not provide an authorization that we signed to charge the account.

We  still do not have our kitchen started, other than the wrong door that was installed. XXXX has provided an invoice to us and XXXX, for {$5000.00} dollars for product that was ordered, for our job. We gave XXXX the opportunity to complete the job, with the product he ordered. But when we asked where the product was, he said because we cancelled the contract, he doesn\\'t have the product anymore. We never cancelled the contract in writing, only verbally. The only credit to date as of XX/XX/2019, is a partial over charge of {$5000.00} dollars. Which still leaves both contract amounts of {$16000.00}, a left off balance of the over charge of {$120.00} dollars, which equals {$16000.00} left on the XXXX account. We have offered to pay XXXX in cash and keep the wrong door, only if he credits back the XXXX account in full first. XXXX said on a recorded line by XXXX, that he has spent the money charged to our account. He said he is a small business, and needs time to pay the account back and make payments. XXXX denied his request for time to pay back the account, and XXXX said it was going to another level of upper management. XXXX informed us that, XXXX in upper management would be taking over the claim. We tried reaching out to XXXX multiple times, and then we were informed that XXXX was not upper management, only another manager. XXXX then told us, XXXX in upper management will be taking over the claim. And that she is in charge of credit and charge backs. We were assured once again, that XXXX would get the charges on the account reversed. After speaking with XXXX multiple times, and conference calls with XXXX and XXXX. There still is no resolution to my claim, other than a partial over charge credit of {$5000.00} dollars. XXXX informed us that once again, the claim was being passed on to upper management. When we asked her, we were told you were upper management. She replied no, that she was just another account manager. To date XX/XX/2019, this is where my account stands.

I also have several other credit cards as well with fairly high limits. I recently have made some rather large purchases with the intent of paying them off rather quickly in the next few months. I get an email from CitiCards for both of my Citi cards that they are decreasing my credit limit due to me making some large purchases on my other credit cards and my fico score decreasing. I called Citi Card and explained to them that I had made some bigger purchases than normal and that they would be paid off within the next 90 days and asked them to reinstate my previous credit limit and they refused. I even offered to provide proof of the resources that I have to pay off my total credit card debt. Since they based their decision based upon my XXXX report they could clearly see that I have never made a late payment on any of my accounts and that I have several accounts that have \"\" XXXX \\'\\' balance. They still refused to reinstate my previous limit. This is going to have a very negative affect on my fico score, which is the very thing they are saying is their concern, it dropped to XXXX. With there decrease it will drop more.

I called the number and after several questions the man told me that my computer was compromised but that he could take care of the problem. After instructing me to go to different sights he was able to gain remote access which I didn\\'t realize was his intent. He showed me a screen that XXXX foreign hackers were attempting to get into my personal information. Another screen showed that my XXXX components and my virus protection had been removed but that he could restore them. He warned me that this could happen again but that he could offer me lifetime support with security for {$2900.00}. I didn\\'t agree right away because it was a large sum but I was worried enough about my personal information being at risk that I agreed and gave him my Bank of America credit card number. He submitted it and I had to okay the charge on my XXXX which I did. I told a couple of my computer savvy friends about it that afternoon and they advised me that I had been scammed and to contact my credit card company right away and reverse the charges. I called Bank of America two hours later when I returned home. I also wanted to request a new card and to cancel the current card. Because it was a Sunday I was informed that I would need to call back on Monday during regular business hours to change cards. I called Bank of America on XX/XX/2019 and asked them to reverse the charges on my current card and to issue me a new card. I was told that they couldn\\'t do anything about the charge until it posted which could take a week. I called back twice after that to see if it had posted and finally it had. I asked them to reverse the charge because it was a scam. I was told that I would have to file a dispute which I did. In the meantime I contacted my personal credit union where I bank and reported the problem in order to get a new debit card issued in case the scammers had obtained that information while on my computer. I was connected to the fraud department of the credit union. I filled her in on what had happened and she advised me to not have any more contact with the fraudulant company and asked if I would like to speak with a representative of XXXX. She connected me to a representative and I repeated everything that had happened. She also advised me to have no further contact with the fraudulent company and to let her know when I heard back from Bank of America about the dispute. Both the woman from the fraud department and the woman from XXXX advised that I take my computer to a reputable company and have it cleaned which I did. They found access points and no virus protection and repaired those issues. I was contacted by Bank of America by email and I filled out information online and tried to explain the situation to the best of my ability. A few days later I received postal mail from Bank of America asking for a list of items that I should send to them. I filled those papers out to the best of my ability and included substantiating papers and sent them by mail on XX/XX/2019. I received a letter from Bank of America dated XX/XX/2019 stating that they concluded that my dispute was not valid and that I needed to pay the amount in question I was out of state at the time so when I returned home I contacted my representative at XXXX and we placed a conference call to Bank of America where we were connected with a dispute agent. After explaining everything to him he felt that not everything had been considered in the dispute and he opened a new dispute on XX/XX/2019. On XX/XX/2019 I received a letter from Bank of America that stated \"\" regrettably we\\'re unable to obtain credit to your account from the merchant. \\'\\' Against the advice I had gotten I finally called the fraudulent company on XX/XX/2019 and asked them for a refund. I explained that I felt that I had been scammed and that I wanted to cancel my subscription and issued a refund. She said that was not possible because it was past the 30 day cancellation period. I informed her that no one told me on the phone or in an email that they had a 30 day cancellation policy and that I had not requested their services since our initial contact so I had not taken advantage of their services and that I wanted a refund. She said she would discuss it with her manager and call me back in 1-2 hours. I never received a call.

The stated cost was {$6.00} for shipping and handling. I was sent a package containing moisturizing cream and eye serum. I did not request eye serum. No invoice or price was included in the package. Without prior notification, on XX/XX/2019, a charge was made to my credit card of {$88.00} for the cream and {$89.00} for eye serum. The merchant did not communicate with me in any way, but sent another package which was refused at the post office. I notified my credit card company of the unauthorized charge, and they obtained a payment cancellation on XX/XX/2019. Another charge was submitted on XX/XX/2019 from the same merchant. Payment to the merchant was withheld at that time. The \"\" free \\'\\' sample was returned, post paid. \\n\\nHowever, in XXXX and XXXX, the credit card company determined, based on documents provided by the merchant, in favor of the merchant in the amount of {$350.00}, even though I submitted my case and cited violation of 16 CFR part 251 and 16 CFR part 245.1 ( 2 )', 'On two of four billing cycles with my XXXX Credit Card ( Comenity Bank ), I was charged late fees and interest. In all four instances, the payments were sent electronically by my bank ( XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) well in advance of the due date. Each statement also clearly states that finance charges would occur if the payment was not received ( as opposed to cleared or processed ) by the due date. In the two cases where I was charged late payment fees and interest, both payments were sent electronically 7 days ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and 8 days ( XXXX XXXX ) in advance of the due date ( XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX respectively ). My bank advised that I allow 5 days for each payment to reach Comenity. My bank record show that neither  payment was cleared ( processed ) by Comenity Bank until 8 days ( XX/XX/XXXX XXXX and 12 days ( XXXX XXXX ) respectively. One of the four billing cycles in which I was not charged a late fee was when the payment was sent on XXXX XXXX ( due XXXX XXXX, cleared on XXXX XXXX ) and XX/XX/XXXX ( due XX/XX/XXXX, cleared on XX/XX/XXXX ). \\n\\nI called XXXX after receiving the late fees and interest charges on my XXXX Statement ( payment sent on XX/XX/XXXX, cleared on XX/XX/XXXX ) and the XXXX agent acknowledged the mistake and removed the charges. I notified Comenity ( instead of XXXX ) the second time it happened, on my XXXX Statement ( payment sent on XX/XX/XXXX, cleared XX/XX/XXXX ). I also want to note that I sent the XXXX payment on the same day that I received the XXXX. Statement from Comenity via email, just to make sure the payment got to Comenity on time. In my secure message conversation with Comeity about the problem, their agent informed me that they waived the XXXX charges as a onetime courtesy and refused to entertain the idea that any fault may lie in their management of my account. I then contacted XXXX and the XXXX agent removed the fees, but said it was because XXXX did not want to lose me as a customer. Like Comenity, she would not consider the idea that there may be some problems with how Comenity is managing XXXX customer charge accounts. \\n\\nI paid off my balance with Comenity, minus the late fees and interest charges and will cancel my XXXX charge account after the payment for items I bought since the XXXX. Statement clear my bank. Although my problem has been resolved, I am filing this complaint because I have serious concerns that other XXXX and Comenity Bank customers may be experiencing overcharges with respect to late fees and interest charges on balances. If it happened to me in two of only four statements total ( 50/50 chance in my case ), and I still don\\'t know how to avoid the problem in the future. it seems likely that this may be happening to others who do business with Comenity or XXXX.\"\\nXXXX Through XXXX my XXXX checking account was hacked into twice and my account was frozen. As a XXXX, I was already having a hard time making credit card payments. All email, and phone correspondents with Capital One indicated that if I made my minimum balance by XX/XX/XXXX, the account would remain open and in good standing. I made those payments, in fact paid it off almost completely. After making the payment Capital One informed me that my account was restricted and going to be closed. I have been defrauded into making a large payment that I couldn\\'t really afford with promises of my account remaining in good standing. I have spent the past 3 days trying to contact them, over 4 hours on the phone just to be told by an over worked, super rude, customer service agent that their was nothing he could do. This company should be held accountable for it\\'s shady business practices, and for taking advantage of the poor. Along with more emails than attached, I have phone calls recorded. I made payments of XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX under the assumption that my account would remain in good standing. Capital One customer service, is misleading people with this practice.\\nIve been waiting for at least a month for credit decision and application to be approved for credit card and I called the security dept and they were rude to me and kept saying that they never receive the documents from and I mailed them since XX/XX/XXXX and I send it priority mail and I also fax it in on XX/XX/XXXX and still no decision on my application and no one isnt helping me and ... I talk to a young lady from the security dept and she was acting unprofessional and told me it was a waiting game and told me i cant Jump ahead of customers and the documents come in .. in the order of receive and Ive been sending at least 3 documents and she also said if I keep on sending documents again that it will start the credit decision all over again my application number is XXXX\\nToday, XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX, I called Navy Federal Credit Union at XXXX & spoke with XXXX   to open a credit card charge dispute on my account for the following amount, {$8000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke with XXXX and explained the fraud from XXXX XXXX DBA XXXX XXXX XXXX that took place on XX/XX/XXXX. Now, XXXX stated that she will open a credit card dispute but they generally except disputes within 60 days of the transaction date. Now, XXXX XXXX failed to disclose accurately about there company. XXXX XXXX told us verbally that members can get vacation packages trip 2 years in advance over any other resorts & that there membership is cheaper than XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX  notified us about yearly membership fees along with amount but failed to inform us verbally that they go up every year. The resort promised 2 free trips for attending, that we must use within 1 year which we later found out we cant use because the resort sell out 2 years in advance for Hawaii trips. These resorts mislead consumers like my spouse and I to join their resort. If we had known the truth, we would have NEVER became members. Now, we discovered the truth when we contacted XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX, when we requested a trip to Hawaii for XX/XX/XXXX, for 10 people and were told that they sell out for there Hawaii trips 2 years in advance which means that these resort companies failed to disclose this information prior to signing the contract. Now, we never knew there was fraud until XX/XX/XXXX. We were not able to dispute this transaction until now because we contacted XXXX XXXX to resolve this issue but they failed to do anything about this matter. Then we filed complaints against the resorts with the XXXX along with the State of Nevada. As of today, we have not heard anything from the XXXX  or the State of Nevada! Again, XXXX said we generally have 60 days from the time of the transaction to file a dispute. In most cases, people know about the fraud with in that time. Since we didn\\'t know about the fraud until XX/XX/XXXX, our 60 days should start at this time which means we should have until XX/XX/XXXX to file this card dispute which we want to do! We should be allowed to have all of our funds be returned to us in full since these resorts failed to disclose everything to everyone prior to signing the contract which does violate state law ( s ) NRS 119A.710 deceptive or unfair acts, NRS 119A.410 misrepresentation, and possibly NRS 205.330 for fraud. We request to be allowed to file the dispute for these charges and get all of our funds returned immediately due to the fraud that these resorts created.\\nThis kind of account is placed as a charged off account, be sure to inform me precisely why there\\'s a balance indicating on the document whetherit \\'s a charge off? The balance is in fact wrong, please make sure to reverseit to zero or remove the item fully.

I then received a phone call from this number. The representative did not introduce themselves or ask for my name or have any of my information. I told them I am not a member of Synchrony bank and this was sent to me in error. I hung up. The man called me again form the same number and told me that this misunderstanding happens sometimes and he just needed more information to deny the claim. I then hung up. \\n\\nWhen I called Synchrony Bank on XX/XX/2020 and spoke to their Fraud department, they informed me I did have a closed account from years ago with Synchrony Bank but it did not end in XXXX.', 'On XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, 32 charges totaling {$1400.00} were made at XXXX XXXX ; a merchant I have never transacted with before. Citi called me around XX/XX/XXXX to see if these were transactions I authorized. I confirmed they were not my charges and they closed the account for fraud and reissued me a new card and said they would remove the charges. \\n\\nIn XXXX after hearing from a friend who had an issue with double charges on her Citi account, I went back and did an audit of my account. I found that they had only done a reversal on 18 of the 32 charges - leaving 14 charges totaling {$300.00} on my account. \\n\\nI contacted Citi to dispute these charges which was done. The following is where I am with those 14 disputes : -4 charges of {$140.00} received affidavit returned to the company ( assume resolved ) -6 charges of {$76.00} no affidavit received, not reversed back to my account ( pending? ) -4 charges of {$79.00} no affidavit received, reversed back to my account ( fraud that was incorrectly credited to my account ). \\n\\nI have contacted Citi several times, even spoke to a manager out of South Dakota after not receiving any resolution from the associate in the disputes department. The manager assured me the incorrect reversal would be credited to my account the following month ( XXXX ), which did not happen. \\n\\nAfter contacting Citi over 5 times and spending hours on the phone and offline with Excel spreadsheets and reading billing statements, I believe this needs to be escalated with the CFPB. They advertise zero fraud liability, yet I am being charged for fraud and spending hours of my time resolving the issue. The ownness is on Citi, not the customer.', 'I was offered a credit card in store when I made a large purchase of over {$500.00}. I excepted the card and never received the actual credit card. \\nAbout two months later I receive the statement with the total amount of the purchase and late fees - even though I still hadnt received the card nor a previous statement. \\nI had tried to create an account online to pay it off quickly and I couldnt do that because I didnt have the card. \\nI called to complain and they said they would send me another card. Meanwhile I decided to pay off the total amount and they said they would take off the late fee since I wasnt able to pay due to the problems with the carD delivery. \\nI spent over an hour on the phone they told me they would takeoff the late fee and I paid the total balance and asked to close my account.

At the time I called they dispute the charge because it was there mistake, now it was done again after I paid my card off before the due date. Capital one is stealing money from me and cant even explain the issue on why. Everyone I called did nothing after I was charged for interest for no reason whey card is paid off every before the due date. This is out of control.i was charge {$8.00}, the charge is not the issue, the issue is your stealing form customers after they pay off their debt before the due date.\\n\"American Express, Sent me a letter informing me of the incorrect Credit Limit that was applied to my account. In the letter American Express indicated that the increase was due to a system error. This have completely decimated my trust in one of the most established and reputable creditors in the world. A creditor to which I am an investor and holder  of your common stock. This error on American Expresses part has burden me with financial damages. As with this oversight they have Defrauded me.\\n\\nWith the increase in Credit Limit it allowed for my Credit Score and my Credit Limit to increase. Giving me more access to spending without negatively impacting my credit ratio. This higher credit limit provided me false confidence when making large purchases as it would still show that I had thousands of dollars of Available Credit. This decrease in my credit limit is going to impact my credit score and toughen my chances of obtaining access to different lines of credit.\"\\nI purchased a couch from XXXX XXXX XXXX , and Synchrony Bank issued a credit card for the purpose of providing interest-free, installment financing for the purchase. The couch was defective, as verified by an inspection performed on behalf ot he seller, and we paid the credit card installments as due while the seller was working with us to resolve this issue. The seller sent us a second couch, but it has the same defect as the first, and the seller has refused to take any further action in connection with this matter. We have made repeated submissions to Synchrony Bank, but the responses are all based on the seller \\'s replacement of the couch and Synchrony Bank has repeatedly ignored our clear explanation that the second couch has the same defect and has ignored our statement that the seller has refused to further work with us. I believe that Synchrony Bank is ignoring our statements because it has a conflict of interest because of its special business relationship with the seller by providing the financing services, so that Synchrony Bank \\'s responses have not been in good faith. Synhrony Bank obviously thinks that its flow of business from the seller is more important than dealing in good fiath with me.\\n\"I received a letter from Navy Federal Credit Union dated XX/XX/XXXX, which indicated that my credit card balance exceeded my approved credit card limit. They requested that I remit a {$260.00} to bring my account balance within my approved credit limit. The problem I have with Navy Federal is that I have never gone over my approved credit limit. In this particular case I had at least {$400.00} ( or a little more available to use ), I made 3 purchases two on XX/XX/XXXX, and one on XX/XX/XXXX all below or NOT OVER the credit limit. On XX/XX/XXXX, Navy Federal charged 3 times interest for purchases, transfer balance and interest ( {$10.00}, {$250.00}, & {$4.00} ). My concern is not these amounts or the interest as I know this has to be done. But it put my credit limit over and this is NOT my fault - I stayed in the limit and not over but when Navy Federal added in the interest it went over and it looks like its my fault and this is reported to the credit reporting agencies and this is not fair. \\nI called Navy Federal with my concerns and received no satisfaction other than the fact they said the \"\" overlimit \\'\\' would be reported. \\nThis I feel is an abuse and an unfair practice.

If you check your recorded logs of the numerous phone calls, and online chats with your low-level credit collectors, I  repeatedly requested that my accounts be escalated to a supervisor to work out a settlement or reasonable payment schedule. I indicated I would prefer to work out an agreement, rather than file for bankruptcy. \\n\\nThese collectors only had the authority to offer the standard $ XXXX per month on each card.

I also stated that at my age and with the threat of the virus, death could be an option. I do appreciate you did not take this as fact and address your letter care of my estate. \\n\\nI believe Amex is non-compliant in cancelling my accounts on my supposed intent to file for bankrupcy, and to advise me to write to a PO box ( which does not accept certified mail ) and no named individual to  write for questions.\", 'On XX/XX/XXXX signed up for a 30-day trial of XXXX  ( grocery delivery service ) Made an order that was completely a mess - called XXXX company to cancel service that same day when mistakes where made with the first and only attempt to use their delivery service. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX noticed a charge was made to my Capital One card - contacted both Capital One and XXXX to disupute the charges - spent over 90 mins on the phone with Capital One representative who added a representative on the phone from XXXX to our conversation.

Called Capital One by phone on XX/XX/XXXX to dispute the charges once again - senior dispute representative of Capital One explained to me that I would need to supply an email from Instacart from initial ( one year ago ) dispute indicating account was closed. I explained that I dont believe they ever sent me an email as we completed this over the phone - phone conversations are recorded as the Capital One representative had assured me the day we made the call w/all parties on the phone and XXXX had agreed - on the phone that the account was closed. \\n\\nI am therefore once again disputing the charges in the amount of {$99.00} for the XXXX XXXX charges to my Capital One card for a service that I did NOT agree too.', \"Good Evening, On XX/XX/2021 a check for XXXX was applied to my credit card.

As of XX/XX/2021 both cases were closed and I was left with a bill for XXXX and Bank of America provided me with no proof as to who could've committed this crime. They did however try to blame my husband who is the authorized user on my card. First of all, my husband would never write a check in order to receive money that we already have. Secondly, their is no way that he could've even done this due to the fact that we both work from home and he does n't drive, so I am his only means of transportation. Moreover after the denial from Bank of America I contacted XXXX and went ahead and filed a police report. XXXX was very helpful and provided me with guidance on how to move forward with filing my report. At this time, I am just waiting for Bank of America to re-review my case so that I can find out who actually did this. Furthermore, I did submit my police report to Bank of America along with a request for Identifying factors for the suspect.

My account and information transferred correctly ; however, I had attempted to use my Walmart Credit Card to make an in-store purchase on XX/XX/XXXX, and the card was declined. I used my card on XX/XX/XXXX for {$37.00}, so I thought it was weird that the card declined only a few days later when my limit is {$100.00}. I checked the Capital One app to see if my card was disabled or if I may have received a new Walmart card that I needed to activate. My account gave me an error message, stating \"\" this credit card account is currently restricted. \\'\\' I had called to XX/XX/XXXX to see why there was an issue with the card and why my account is restricted.

I was told that Capital One closed the account due to \"\" returned payments \\'\\' and that the representatives could not do anything about this, but my billing statements and payment screen on the Capital One app correctly reflects the charges and payments I made to this account. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Capital One at my permanent address dated for XX/XX/XXXX.

According to the records that I am able to see, I have made payments on time and received rewards for my purchases that I am not able to redeem since my account is closed. I have not received or been given access to a billing statement that reflects charges and payments made after XX/XX/XXXX.

I have received a letter from the bank stating that I have won this dispute and that the money would be credited to me. It has been 20 days and there is no sign of the money that I have been promised. This is not a small amount so it is dragging my available credit down. I have called the bank multiple times and spoken to multiple specialists who have told me that they will put in reports and escalate it to no avail. I have had nothing but positive experiences with this banks fraud services except for this one. It has been 20 days and there is no sign of my money.

The private hospital where we sent her asked for a credit card before they would release her. My wife gave out her Discover card number only as a pre-authorization. The hospital initially said that they would not even take the card as it was not a card recognized in XXXX. \\n\\nUpon releasing my wife from the hospital we arranged payment for the bill by alternate means. We had money wired directly from another bank. I immediately called Discover customer service to have the hold on our account released. The amount was showing up as a pending charge for around {$7600.00}. \\n\\nThe first agent was very unhelpful and routed it as fraud, not explaining the situation correctly. This revealed a lack of training. I had the card cancelled not knowing that since a hold had already been placed for {$7600.00}, it would not matter. This will put us through an inconvenience as we had several accounts set to auto-pay with that card. Then after several more escalations to different agents and management, I was told that they could do nothing for me and I would just have to wait to see if the hospital did not reverse the charge. And they would not let me start a billing dispute either. \\n\\nFinally the last person I spoke with ( a manager named XXXX ) refused to even give me a email where I could reach them with further documentation that the bill had already been paid. This person used dishonest tactics to just try and get rid of me. I explained multiple times to multiple people that we had arranged payment for the hospital bill by alternate means but as of today XX/XX/2020 the pending charge for around {$7600.00} is still on my card. \\n\\nDiscover financial also seems to have very poor customer service technology as several calls had to be dropped due to poor quality, leading to me having to call back multiple times.', 'I\\'ve had a credit card, checking, and savings account with Alliant since XXXX. I\\'ve never been late with a payment and had over $ 30K on deposit with them at the time of closure. \\n\\nI received a letter in XXXX that there was an annual meeting and I was expelled and my membership would be terminated XX/XX/XXXX. While I appreciate the notificiation and time to change auto payments, I feel the timing of this was due to COVID-19. \\n\\nIf I was non-compliant with something, I would appreciate being told what it was and have the opportunity to correct it rather than being shut down during a crisis and while on lockdown.\"\\nI received my bill in the mail, and noticed I had a total payment due of XXXX, and my payment is XXXX a month. I had medical issues and did fall behind on my payment. I did miss a payment in XXXX, and XXXX, as well as XXXX. They took a payment out for XX/XX/XXXX, they have taken one out for XX/XX/XXXX, and have another to come out on XX/XX/XXXX, which is post dated, and comes out automatically. I was not sent a letter saying that i was in recovery, until i called tonight to see why my whole minimum payment is XXXX. They have my email on file and phone number, I realize my two payments are late, but there is no way I can afford XXXX, nor have they informed if my account will be charged off. I would like to work out a plan with them, Customers should be informed in writing.\\n\"Around XX/XX/2020, I noticed 2 charges on my credit card that I did not authorized. \\nI contacted Citibank, they issued a new card with new card number, put the transactions into dispute, and then issued temporary credit. The charges were dated XX/XX/2020 I got a response on one of the items yesterday, XX/XX/2020 and Citibank was going to reverse the temporary credit as if I lost the dispute. \\n\\nI believe the merchant was involved in the scam. The merchant have a website that is no longer active. The domain was created on XX/XX/2020. \\n\\nOn first pass, Citibank took the merchants word. I am still placing the complaint back into dispute. \\n\\nIn short the credit card company is offering me little protection from a fraudulent charge that may involve a form of identity theft.\"\\nIt states on my credit report that the account is closed but it is still reporting negative payments. It states that there are XXXX charge offs on this account! XXXX is still reporting negative inaccurate information. The account is closed so how is that fair they get to keep reporting negative charge offs? It is still reporting as of XX/XX/2020. Its written off and still reporting negative.\\n\"I have been trying to fix this issue since XX/XX/2019. Bank of America has now screwed up two of my accounts trying to fix it. I wrote my last letter on XX/XX/2019, and have not heard from them since. I am so frustrated I am at my wit \\'s end. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/2019, I made a payment from my bill pay account to the wrong account. The account ending in XXXX was no longer an active account. I did not realize this until my credit card showed I had not made my payment. In investigating this, I realized what I had done. I then called Bank of America \\'s toll-free number and spoke with an agent and she said she would send my information to another department for investigation and they would get back to me. When I did not hear from anyone, I called back and got the same song and dance. After another interval without hearing from anyone, I decided I would message my concerns from the internal messaging system in my account. I sent no less than 8 messages, with only \"\" canned \\'\\' or no responses. \\n\\nIt was then I started my letter-writing campaign. My first letter was dated XX/XX/2019, and Bank of America sent me a letter back, dated XX/XX/2019, stating they could not find the payment I was talking about. This, even though, I had sent a detailed letter explaining everything and copies of all the documentation ( even a screen print of the account the {$57.00} payment was made to ). \\n\\nI wrote them back on XX/XX/2019, and sent all the attachments again and explained the situation again. On XX/XX/2019, I received a letter stating they had found the {$57.00} and credited it to my account. What they actually did was take a payment made to my husband \\'s credit card and put that money toward \\'s my account. \\n\\nMy last letter was dated XX/XX/2019, and was directed to a Manager and told them what they did was totally wrong. I, once again, included all the documentation and told them EXACTLY what had happened. \\n\\nSince this last letter, I have heard nothing from them. It has now been over a month. This shouldn\\'t be that hard. I told them exactly where the money went and gave them proof of that multiple times.

After reviewing my credit report I found out that my Paypal account was reporting to the credit agencies as a credit card account. I contacted Paypal and was advised that they started it to report to the credit agencies since XX/XX/2019 ( This is the 1st time I see this account from Synchrony bank on my credit report ) According to the representative Synchrony bank took over Paypal. It shows on my credit report I\\'m over my credit line over {$500.00} and is affecting my FICO score. I told the associate over the phone I was never ever advised that I had a credit line for my paypal account or what my credit line was. She couldn\\'t provide me with anything in writing, I\\'m at the middle of refinancing my current home and this significant hit on my FICO score will prevent me from refinancing. I just made a payment to bring my account under the credit limit.\\n\"I had a Discover IT secured card opened in XX/XX/2019, which had 100 % payment history and I always paid off my balance and kept great record of my credit, so Discover returned my deposit and increased my credit line which was awesome considering I\\'m rebuilding my credit. In XX/XX/2019 I legally changed my first and middle name, so I contacted XXXX to update them and sent them my legal documents for the name change, and they updated my info and sent me a new card. In XXXX or XX/XX/2019, Discover needed me to sign a document to have my information verified through the IRS, so I signed it and a few weeks later Discover informed me they were closing my account due to not being able to verify my information with the IRS but couldn\\'t tell me what information and left it at that. I then get a letter from the IRS about some of my information being requested but unable to verify, which the piece of unverifiable information was my NAME, why.. because I haven\\'t filed taxes under my new name yet! Discover knew about my name change and still decided to close my account after months of nothing but good history with them. So now thanks to them I have a closed account on my credit report when their unverifiable information they already knew about, so why couldn\\'t they either request a different way to verify my information or take into consideration that I just recently changed my name and it hasn\\'t been fully updated with the IRS considering we haven\\'t filed taxes for 2019 yet!

This has never been done in nearly XXXX years with their credit card, even after over XXXX days late payment multiple times while living overseas doing a Masters degree on a strict budget with income checks often mailing and depositing late. When I then logged on to the Navy Federal website on XX/XX/XXXX, I was immediately given an other than normal screen, not the regular accounts overview page it has been for all these years, but a never before seen special credit card payment screen. Which had a prefilled amount of double payment ~ {$1000.00}, that I did not see an option to change the amount of. So I was manipulated to pay double when I wanted to just pay the late payment so I could buy the groceries. Then, the following month, last month I could no longer afford to pay my Navy Federal credit card bill XX/XX/XXXX, due to ongoing health and employment problems, and now waiting for a surprise court/legal document to process so I could pay that potential {$500.00} bill first, from my {$2600.00} savings remaining. I figured I would delay payment another month, or as many as required, before paying, or pay partial payment, along with any late fee like they have charged in the past. Come XX/XX/XXXX I checked my bank account online, no abnormal late/double payment screen presented this time, and I find that on XX/XX/XXXX Navy Federal on their own without my explicit transfer authorization, went and took the {$50.00} remaining from my Navy Federal savings account, and {$470.00} from my checking account, and paid the credit card themselves, and without notifying me, and after charging a \"\" late fee \\'\\'. Interestingly as well, the over limit balance was the highest it has ever been at {$27000.00}, yet the minimum payment which they took, was not the highest ever, being midrange {$510.00}, so I don\\'t know how they are calculating all my previous minimum payments for years that have been higher, but for lower total credit card balance. Anyhow, after messaging them, they said it is part of their credit card \"\" security \\'\\' policy to take funds if you don\\'t pay. I have never heard of this in nearly XXXX years, and do not agree to it, regardless of where it might be hidden in the \"\" fine print \\'\\'. It has never been done before when a payment was late. This is theft. They can not arbitrarily access and take whatever funds they wish from the savings peoples lives depend on. I have requested multiple times for them to return the funds, and that I will pay that credit card when and however I can later as I have always done. They do not have a right to take and disrupt peoples finances, and as in my case, potentially get them sent to jail for not being able to pay court fees first. Especially disrupting peoples finances, deviating from norms, or taking peoples money when they are in a bind and need it most. Not to mention the fact that if they can just take your money if it\\'s late, then why are they ever allowed to charge a late payment fee, or why even allow automatic scheduled minimum monthly payments, if they are going to take your money when they want to anyway? If you are charged a late payment fee, then that is your punishment, not taking that fee and then take the due amount money anyway. It is intentionally deceptive and dishonest practice. They do not even notify you that they will be, or did take the money, so you can plan accordingly. Who decided which accounts to take the money from, and why? Who decided how much to take from each account, and why? The issues involved in this can be expounded to no end.', 'In XXXX of XXXX I noticed that my Best Buy Credit Card balance was barely going down, despite always making timely payments.

I asked him if there was a charge, to which he informed me that there was. I denied the coverage. When my first statement arrived, I saw that debt protection had STILL made it\\'s way onto my bill. I called IMMEDIATELY to have it removed. Several statements after that came back free of the charge. So how did it make it back onto my account when I had so clearly said that I DIDN\\'T want it? \\n\\nI called Best Buy right away, they informed me that they no longer offer debt protection and that was something offered on the older cards. I would have to call the Debt Protection company themselves ( XXXX  ) to have it cancelled. They connected me to XXXX who cancelled my Debt Protection as of XX/XX/XXXX. When I asked to have all of the money refunded that they had taken out without my consent, they said they would have to put in a request and I would be informed of a decision within 30 days. \\n\\nLater that month I recieved a letter ( from Best Buy, not XXXX themselves ) stating that I had \"\" purchased \\'\\' the protection on XX/XX/XXXX and because my account \"\" was protected by the program benifits \\'\\' throughout that time any \"\" previously billed fees are valid and nonrefundable. \\'\\' I was dismayed. I had no idea what my account had actually been protected FROM, considering I was completely unaware that this fee had been placed onto my account in the first place, and the Debt Protection program was never mentioned or explained to me in the least. \\n\\nI went online to check all of my old statements, and unfortunately, was only able to see back 2 years. But in that two year window ( XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX ) Best Buy Debt Protection had stolen {$930.00} from me. And that\\'s not including the 8 ADDITIONAL YEARS that they had been doing this without my knowledge. \\n\\nI called Best Buy again on XX/XX/XXXX and immediately asked to speak to a supervisor. I spoke to XXXX on the management team, who basically told me the same thing : They haven\\'t dealt with XXXX since XXXX and I would have to deal with them directly. She connected me back to XXXX, where I spoke with XXXX. XXXX said they would put in a request and she\\'d \"\" see what she could do. \\'\\' I informed her that they had already done this, and I got rejected. She responded with, \"\" Let \\'s just do this and see what happens. \\'\\' Sure enough, I was denied again. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I called Best Buy for a THIRD time and spoke to XXXX on the management team. I told him that I no longer wish to be connected to XXXX. Because when I get the rejection letters in the mail, they don\\'t come from XXXX, they come from BEST BUY. XXXX wouldn\\'t have even had my name in the first place if BEST BUY wouldn\\'t have given it to them under deceptive circumstances. Citibank, who controls the Best Buy card was ALREADY sued for this back in XXXX and had to pay customers MILLIONS of dollars as a result. But unfortunately, the problem isn\\'t solved, as they continue to do this to people. A quick XXXX search confirms that there are still SO MANY OF US that this is happening to. \\n\\nXXXX essentially called me a liar and said that I must have signed up for it somewhere. ( Which, if they have my signature agreeing to this ANYWHERE, it was received in a dishonest and sneaky manner, because I NEVER would have signed up for the program I made so blatantly clear that I DIDN\\'T want all those years ago ). He told me that they couldn\\'t dispute claims farther back than 6 months, and the only thing I could POSSIBLY do at this point is send a hand-written letter to the Disputes Department so that they could \"\" show me where I agreed to it. \\'\\' I\\'m at a loss for what to do at this point. \\n\\nI\\'m sad for everyone this is happening to. \\n\\nWhen someone steals your card and makes a ton of false charges, it\\'s pretty easy to cancel the card and get your money back ; but what happens when the people who are stealing from you are the credit card companies themselves?', \"My wife tried to use my Dicks rewards points when making a purchase without me at the store. \\n\\nMy wife thought my dicks rewards covered the bill, but the store clerk supposedly opened up a credit card in my name without my approval or being present.

Again I was never notified of this policy change on a \"\" no foreign transaction credit card \\'. When in XXXX I made a 2nd purchase on XXXX and the merchant said he never received payment.

Move forward I have CANCELED the card and back overseas in XXXX and I get an email saying I have a Late Payment. At no time was I emailed saying I had an outstanding payment. What happened was I was mailed a letter saying that they did not have a cash receipt and credited my CANCELED Account the payment. PLEASE NOTE that I have a XXXX Credit Rating and pay my bills early. There was no way to sign on to A CANCELED ACCOUNT. I payed the bill with A LATE PAYMENT. Back in the state I called and wanted A WORKING Number for the merchant and wanted to know how they contacted them? They said they could not provide a Working Number only the one that was not in service or disconnected. I then said since I do not have an account and was not notified by email about a payment the should reimburse the late fee at a minimum. They said they could not send a check by mail but could credit my CANCELED Account. PLEASE NOTE Capital One is nothing but computer and a Call Center which are usually overseas.

I also want to know how the credit card company INVESTIGATED thev charge that I filed a complaint on? I am paying for a service and believe that did not investigate or contact XXXX via XXXX. This is all unacceptable and they need to start answeing immediately. Thank You CFPB', 'There are several things involved, some of which are more related to credit cards than others. What IS a unifying theme is the ongoing deception from Bank of America, both to convince me to transfer assets ( which is fraud to induce ) and to try to cover their behinds instead of admitting to their errors. We\\'ll start from the top : 1. While discussing a transfer of assets, I was told by a Merrill Lynch representative ( XXXX XXXX ) that I could get two Bank of America Cash Rewards credit cards, which receive bonuses from having assets with Merrill Lynch. He was quite certain about this and even added \"\" I have two personal Cash Rewards cards myself. \\'\\' Later, my application for a second card was rejected because \"\" I already had one and they don\\'t do two of the same product. \\'\\' This was in direct contradiction to what I was told by XXXX, and sorting out the disparity consumed easily a dozen hours ( partially because he kept saying that I could get a second one ). \\n\\n2. I was also given a Merrill Edge promotion promising that within Bank of America \\'s Preferred Rewards program, I would be promoted to Gold within 30 days and Platinum within 60 days. This did not happen and was the subject of a prior complaint that was not satisfactorily resolved. The person I spoke to simply declared the matter resolved based on more deceptive information ( detailed below ). I was promised {$100.00} ( which has yet to be delivered ), which is a trifling compensation for the dozens of hours of time that I sunk into dealing with it ( essentially, Bank of America is valuing my time at under minimum wage instead of taking responsibility for their failure to comply with the promises made by the Merrill subsidiary ). At every point, the Merrill people said the bank side was the only people who could fix it and the bank people said the Merrill people were the only ones who could fix it. \\n\\n3. The first deceptive information that was utilized to declare the previous case \"\" resolved \\'\\' was that I was actually promoted to Gold status on XX/XX/XXXX. This is blatantly false. I did not receive an email on the subject until XX/XX/XXXX. Moreover, I can demonstrate that I wasn\\'t given credit accordingly as far as rewards go. I can prove that their claim I was promoted on XX/XX/XXXX is false. On XX/XX/XXXX, I spent {$52.00} at a gas station, which would earn 3 % at the normal rate and 3.75 % at the Gold Preferred Rewards rate. I earned {$1.00}. $ XXXX/ {$52.00} = XXXX = 3 %. Contrast that with when I spent {$42.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, where I did earn the Gold Preferred rate. I earned {$1.00}. $ XXXX {$42.00} = XXXX = 3.75 %. So I actually lost out on money that should have been earned because of my Preferred Rewards bonus. They flat out refused to credit me for this, which is fraud. \\n\\n4. The second deceptive information that was utilized was the claim that I was not promoted to Platinum because I had fallen below the $ XXXX threshold because I had made {$11.00} of withdrawals. This is absolutely inaccurate. My daily balance NEVER fell below $ XXXX. What they are neglecting is that I earned interest. I withdrew the interest but never touched the principal. Moreover, even 100 days after my initial deposit, when I had qualified for Platinum through the normal non-promotion mechanism ( which uses the 3 month rolling average ), I was STILL not Platinum. The made-up claim that I had fallen below the threshold is simply a smokescreen to cover up the failures of Merrill and Bank of America to communicate.\"\\nI have contacted Bank of America twice about this issue by phone. Its been three weeks since I requested a check refunding a credit balance I have on my account. What is going on? THEY ARE REFUSING TO RETURN MY MONEY.\\n\"I previously filed a complaint with you ( XXXX ) and the bank resolved it and removed the interest that was on the account inaccurately. It is for Account # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. \\n\\nSince it took more than the one statement period for them to remove that inaccurate interest, I am now being charged {$14.00} interest on that inaccurate interest balance. \\n\\nI tried to resolve it and the same outcome as last time, the rep just said that since there was a balance ( even though inaccurate ) at the end of the statment period I am responsible. I am not responsible for inaccurate interest. \\n\\nIf you need more to attach all of the statements again or a copy of the previous complaint that was resolved, let me know. This was BoA \\'s previous response showing I didnt owe the balance. \\n\\nCompany \\'s Response On XX/XX/2019, we spoke with Ms. XXXX regarding her complaint.

We explained to Ms. XXXX that the service she received had been elevated to the appropriate level of management to ensure we continue to uphold our high standard of excellence. Interest Charges accrue daily on the balance until the payment is received in full. At the time the previous monthly billing cycle closed, Interest Charges through that date were included based on the previous unpaid balance.

The account closure letter was dated XX/XX/2020. \\n\\nIt is interesting to note that the letter from TD mentioned only one of my credit cards with them ( a \"\" XXXX XXXX  \\'\\' card ) completely, ignoring my other three personal accounts with TD. \\n\\nI called the phone number on the account closure letter ; it went straight to an answering machine. The message said to leave a phone number, which I did. A gentleman called me back and told me that they had the right to close my account and didn\\'t owe me an explanation. I then pointed out to him that the closure letter itself said that if \"\" any of the accounts referenced above are a credit card account, please note that the Federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act, you have a right to request, within 60 days of receipt of this letter, additional information about the reason for your account closure \\'\\'. He then told me I would have to send that request in writing. \\n\\nWithin a day or so, I could no longer access or view my checking accounts, online. I went down to the branch in XXXX, NJ, where I normally do my banking and spoke to the manager, XXXX. He was most unhelpful and basically shrugged his shoulders and told me it was out of his hands and he could do nothing about it. I was puzzled as to why TD wanted to drop five accounts with close to XXXX XXXX dollars in assets. I then spent another hour or so in the bank getting checks made out to me for the balances in my accounts, so that I could take those monies and deposit the elsewhere in the day or two before the expected shutdowns in NJ, rather than wait for the money to arrive by mail in a week or two. \\n\\nI subsequently sent my letter to TD Bank on XX/XX/XXXX, requesting the reason ( s ) for the account closure. \\n\\nI never received anything back from TD, in writing. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I received a phone message from a XXXX XXXX, who is a TD Branch Manager in XXXX ( the branch where I originally opened one savings and one checking account ). He left an email address to contact him back. i subsequently emailed him on XX/XX/XXXX, asking him to contact me. After several more emails, he finally called me on XX/XX/XXXX. During that phone conversation, he basically told me he had no idea why the account was closed but said \"\" they probably did not like some of the transactions you made \\'\\'. He then ASKED ME if I knew of any reason that his bank would want to close my accounts. I told him that I did not. He then told me that it was strange, and he would look into it and get back to me. He never did. \\n\\nI also wish to point out that the initial account closure letter was dated XX/XX/2020 and stated, \"\" We\\'re closing your TD Bank account ( s ) on XX/XX/2020 \\'\\'. Thinking that it was safe to use my accounts till the XXXX, I made two credit card payments on my wife \\'s credit card bills. one was returned on XX/XX/XXXX and one was returned on XX/XX/XXXX. As a result of these returned payments, my wife \\'s credit score dropped 45 points, from XXXX to XXXX!', 'My name is XXXX XXXX I am Barclays Arrival+ card holder. I am writing in regard to unauthorized charges on my account and unfair treatment by Barclays fraud investigations representatives and denial of fair investigation of my case. \\n\\nIn early XXXX there were unauthorized transactions on my credit card, as I found out about it I have reached out to Barclays right away and have let them know about unauthorized transactions. In that conversation I have mentioned that the card was most likely stolen from my car, thats where I believe I had it. I was asked few questions and then I think I have asked representative if I need to file police report. To what representative told me that I dont need to file it. The credit for unauthorized charges was issued. On XX/XX/XXXX I have left for my month-long business trip to XXXX, returning on XX/XX/XXXX. I have prove of my absence in my passport showing stamps of entering and exiting XXXX countries. In my absence there was a mail sent that was asking me to affidavit that the card was stolen, and that I dont know the person who did still it. I have sent that document in few days after my arrival to USA and saw that the earlier credit was reversed. Then I tried reaching Barclays in regards to that reversal, and at that time it was full blown pandemic and I couldnt reach anyone. After numerous calls I was able to reach someone at customer support and they told me that fraud investigations department is closed due to Covid-19. I have asked if I can pay this card now as I have few days left before past due date and then keep disputing charges. Customer service rep told me yes that this shouldnt be an issue and that it will not have affect on my dispute. \\n\\nThree weeks ago, I was finally able to reach to fraud investigations department and spoke with XXXX. XXXX has advised me then to file a police report and send it with letter. I am 99 % sure that on first call when I reported unauthorized activity I also asked if I need to file a police report, but was told that Barclays doesnt need it. Now 3 months later Barclays is asking for police report and police says that its too late and that they cant do investigation as car was washed and most evidences where removed from car by now. In case if I even didnt ask why you waited for so long to request a police report, you deal with such situations on the daily bases and request a police report only 3 months later knowing that its too late to obtain that police report. I was supposed to be advised on first call to obtain the police report. Arent you dealing with such cases on daily bases, and if police report is one of major documents for this investigation why instead of encouraging me to obtain one you rep told me not to get one? \\n\\nThen I placed multiple more calls trying to understand why this credit was reverted and how I can get fair assessment of this dispute. However, when I reached out to fraud investigation, rep told me that there was a valid charge on the account and right away I told its mistake. Right away I reviewed my account and there was a valid charge which is your annual membership fee. So yes, it is valid charge automatically charged by Barclays every year, but what I have to do with it? Then I had another call, when I tried to explain that its absurd to use automatic annual fee charge as bases to deem fraudulent transactions as authorized. Then new rep by name of XXXX told me that there were other transactions in XXXX that were not approved after unauthorized transactions and that those were deemed valid as thats what I have said to some rep on the phone. I disagree with that as I remember this conversation and that I told specifically that my card was stolen and when rep asked if those transactions were valid, I asked what she means, and she asked if the card was present when transaction were made? To what I replied probably as they have my card and the transaction would go through only with chip. In this context it was obvious that I was referring to them stilling my card and physically using it. But Barclays chose to shuffle the words and make representation that I have said that the charges made after unauthorized charges are authorized. There is a difference between card present and authorized charges, this is misrepresentation and almost fraud! Then XXXX the rep told me, why did you pay then if it wasnt you who made those charges? I wouldnt pay it if it wasnt my charges. What a great way to back the validity of the argument! Well, I paid because I care about my XXXX credit score and because I will need my credit history throughout my life and there is nothing wrong with me paying it not to be reported late and continue to pursue fair resolution of this investigation. I placed multiple other calls with Barclays and every time I was given really ridiculous reasons why these charges are valid and dispute cant be reopened. For example, I spoke with rep XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX and she told me that those charges are valid because XXXX was able to verify me. When I asked how XXXX verified me, she replied that my name was on the receipt. Well, I told her that card has my name on it and my signature on the back so how does that make this verified transaction? She told me that my signature/name is verified and matching. I told her that this is impossible and asked her to review that signature, when she pulled up receipt, she told me there is no name or signature on the receipt. Then she told me that apple verified me by my social security number. And quite honestly, its just a ridiculous misrepresentation because every household has an apple product and never anybody had to verify they social security number to make a purchase at XXXX. This is huge misrepresentations and to some extend fraud if not to big extend. \\n\\nAll that being said, I have an extraordinary amount of stress being caused to me with this unfair investigation and misrepresentations of Barclays employees basically accusing me in fraud while misrepresenting facts and committing fraud themselves. And based on my recent conversation with manager XXXX he understood the situation and advised me to write 2 letters, one to fraud investigations department and another one to executive office. He told me that the case most likely will be reopened and will be given fair assessment. I am writing this letter to request a fair investigation and to assign a single contact person to my case that would be able to examine the entire case and listen to all phone conversations and see what really is true and whats not. Also all reps at Barclays need a better training to resolve fraud issues, however it looks like they were trained to brush clients off with giving 100 misrepresentations to back the denial of dispute. Please be advised that if you will deny me in reopening my case and fair investigation of it. I will turn to CFPB, governor XXXX and senator XXXX to protect my rights. And if they will not be able to help me, I will file a law suite against Barclays Card and sue for unauthorized charges, stress that I had to go through, loss of time, interest on my money and legal fees for attorney. Will also get the press involved telling the story of how I was mistreated and what ridiculous statements were made by your reps. All I want is fair investigation please.', 'On XXXX, I filed a dispute with Chase Visa for a charge to my account made by XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) on XXXX. The charge was for two 1-way airline tickets from XXXX, XXXX to XXXX XXXX, XXXX, scheduled for XXXX. On XXXX, I received notice from XXXX XXXX that this flight had been canceled and that a refund \"\" voucher \\'\\' was offered. As this flight was canceled by XXXX XXXX, not me, a full refund to my charge card is allowed by XXXX law and US law ( Fair Credit Billing Act 1974 ). \\nOn XXXX, Chase Visa requested additional information concerning the dispute. On XXXX, I provided copies of the XXXX XXXX email stating they canceled the flight ; copies of my attempts to contact XXXX XXXX for a refund ; a chronology of all communications with Air XXXX ; and a clearly stated summary noting that I did not cancel this flight. XXXX XXXX replied to the dispute that I canceled the flight ( no proof given, just the statement ) and this was a \"\" non-refundable \\'\\' ticket so not eligible for a refund. Chase agreed and said the charges were valid, even though they had written proof I did not cancel this flight. \\nI re-disputed these findings on XXXX providing yet more information and emails from XXXX XXXX showing I did not cancel the flight. Again, on XXXX, Chase Visa replied that, \"\" While you may have a valid complaint with the merchant, the results of our additional review confirm that the transactions are valid and no billing error occurred on your account. \\'\\' I contacted Chase Visa Disputes department and was told that there were no \"\" errors \\'\\' in my billings. The agent also said this was evaluated as a \"\" billing error \\'\\' dispute, not a \"\" merchant did not perform contracted services \\'\\' dispute. She continued to say that there was nothing more that could be done since I had re-disputed these charges, but if I wanted, i could resubmit all my data again and possibly it would be reviewed. \\n\\nI don\\'t understand how this is a valid charge against my account and that Chase Visa has sided with a merchant that clearly has committed fraud, at their own acknowledgment. What can a consumer do in these cases where Chase Visa chooses to blatantly ignore the facts, written proof, and charged the account? Where can I get help? \\nThank you, XXXX XXXX', 'This is my second time filing a complaint. I have been waiting patiently for XXXX MONTHS for Discover to fix access to my online account. \\n\\nI am requesting that Discover follow-up with me via e-mail, as I am currently abroad and unable to pick-up phone calls. \\n\\nI really would like to be able to access my Discover credit card account and Discover bank accounts as for XXXX MONTHS I have been unable to access my accounts or have access to online transfers, bill payments, etc. I thought that Discover should have immediately had people in their I.T web department resolve it for me. However, this thing has unnecessarily dragged on for XXXX months now without any kind of resolution nor follow-up at all from anybody at Discover, and of course, without the issue ever being resolved for me so that I may access my accounts! So this is XXXX months without any access to my banking and credit card accounts with Discover, and there has been no attempt to resolve the technical issues on Discover \\'s end for me. \\n\\nI am copy and pasting the text from my first complaint filed in XXXX, 2019 : On XX/XX/2019, I received a voicemail from Discover \\'s \"\" fraud department. \\'\\' All I did was add an external checking account to my Discover account. I reached out to Discover immediately to inform them that I added the external bank account. However, it was too late. Discover had already deactivated my online access. I\\'ve had one Discover login to manage both my Discover credit card and Discover bank accounts for several years. Everything has ran smoothly up until XXXX  days ago. After Discover took the step of deactivating my online access after mistakenly detecting some kind of fraud on the account, I had to spend an hour on the phone trying to reactivate it. After following all the steps and suggestions on the phone. There is an error after I log in with the account. I can see the accounts listed, but there is an error message next to each account that said : \"\" verify this account. \\'\\' Any link that I clicked on including \"\" verify this acount \\'\\' led to an error page. All of the links inside of the online account led to error pages. I reached out to Discover by phone and chat immediately to let them know what\\'s going on. I can\\'t access my accounts. I can not do anything with any of the accounts. It\\'s very frustrating. I was told on the phone that \"\" headquarters \\'\\' would be working to fix it. Over XXXX days later and there has been no communication what-so-ever from headquarters. No e-mail. I\\'m traveling overseas right now and e-mail is the best way to reach me. But no other form of communication from DIscover. No solutions. It hasn\\'t been fixed. I\\'ve chatted multiple times. There is something bizarre with Discover \\'s chat support. I send a message and then verify my account info. Then I don\\'t get another reply from Discover \\'s support agent for another XXXX minutes. After XXXX minutes the chat times out. It has nothing to do with the Internet connection, it\\'s that literally the support agent is taking up to XXXX minutes to reply. It\\'s like there is one person trying to service XXXX support requests at the same time? What is going on with Discover? I\\'ve never seen such poor online customer support in my whole life. On XXXX, the official Discover account asks me to open the chat and the whole thing repeats. I verify my account through chat, and then it takes XXXX - XXXX minutes to get a reply from the agent or no reply ever comes. This problem that is not my fault, and caused by Discover never gets solved. I wish I could be compensated somehow for how much time I\\'ve wasted trying to get it resolved. It\\'s so crazy. I\\'ve called twice on this issue. Each time I can get through to their U.S support, which is good. But again, each time they say they\\'ve reported the issue to their headquarters and there is nothing else they can do at all. On XX/XX/XXXX, I got an e-mail from Discover with a temporary password. I thought for a moment that they finally fixed the issue and I could now log in. But I try to log in with the temporary password and it doesn\\'t work. I\\'m so disappointed by the lack of communication, lack of a solution, and the fact that this whole thing was caused by a mistake by Discover just for linking an external account to Discover. I\\'ve never seen anything like this before, and never experienced any problem like this before with any other financial company. Since I received the temporary password today, I also can\\'t log in at all.\"\\nI entered into Ch. XXXX Bankruptcy and am to the best of my abilities trying to finish my case and rebuild a life for me and my son. I have done tons of research to try to fix the issue as well as make calls to every number and I have I mailed several letters to every address for Victoria Secret to try to get a 30 day late from 2018 removed from my credit history but every response I received from them basically says no they will not remove it and to basically not ask again.The response was very generic and I don\\'t feel like they put any thought or effort into my plea. I have seen several letters from this company showing where they have made adjustments and I just wanted to same one time courtesy. I do not believe it is fair for consumers who hold this credit card. I spend a lot of money in this store, and that is with and without the credit card. This is the only thing stopping me from securing my mortgage and I have made time payments since 2018. I am just asking for the same courtesy granted to other customers. And if I can\\'t get any help, there is no need for me to keep this credit card or make purchases from this company. I appreciate and look forward to a response.\\n\"Dates of pertinent information : XX/XX/XXXX - Purchased an airline ticket on Chase Credit Card ending XXXX {$2200.00} for my wife and me to fly from XXXX, FL to XXXX, XXXX. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX - Paid off credit card from our Chase checking account ending in XXXX, cancelled credit card account. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX - XXXXXXXX XXXX cancelled trip ( covid ). \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX - Contacted XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX  and was told that the refund would be issued within ten days to the same card that I used to purchase the tickets. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX - Contacted chase at XXXX XXXX - Was told by Customer service operator \"\" XXXX \\'\\' that the card was still in the system and that a refund from a merchant would be accepted and that I would be contacted to determine what account I would like to have the money transferred to.

As the cashier was scanning my clothes, she asked if I would like to save 15 percent on my purchase for the day. I said sure. My purchase was about {$40.00}, something between 40 and 41. With the discount, the price was between {$35.00} and {$36.00}. \\nHeres where the issue came up. The cashier rang up my clothes as the {$40.00} price and the discount was not applied. To avoid any future issues, I asked to pay off the full amount immediately after my purchase. What ended up happening was she only paid off {$35.00} of the {$40.00} because she did not notice the discount was not applied. \\nSo about five dollars was left on the card for several months and the balance build up on the 29 percent annual interest. I had no idea of the balance until I finally got a letter in the mail from XXXX XXXX saying that I had owed {$71.00}. \\nA few days later I went into XXXX to resolve the issue. They told me to call XXXX XXXX which is who the card is issued through. I believe this bank is located in Delaware. \\nI call and tell them the situation. They tell me that they can not just clear the {$71.00}, some of it has to be paid. So I get them to lower the balance to {$17.00} which seemed a lot better than {$71.00}.

Now I have waited more than 10 business days. Comdata supplied me an email stating they have posted the {$51.00} provisional credit today. They never did post that to my account. They flat out maliciously lied and are trying to test my knowledge. They are very un compassionate and rude in this regards.

I kept going back and forth with Comenity Bank for over a month or 2 and after that I just gave up. This destroyed my credit and took my score down tremendously.

I called BoA on XX/XX/XXXX and questioned why the credit card payment did not go through and if there was a problem with the routing and checking account number. I confirmed both, then their phone banker confirmed the failed payment was due to a system update Bo did that impacted ( cancelled/nullfied ) the timely payment I made and that it was due to factors that were not in my control ( i.e.BoA system update ). They then charged me a late charge on my account due to this, then did not notify me that the payment failed to be applied due to their system update issue. She then told me she would refund the late fee to my account, then I requested the same ACH payment be made with the phone banker, to which she input it to be made to my account. Their system update not only cancelled my timely payment, it resulted in an unnecessary late charge, and my account showing past due. The banker confirmed none of it was my fault. \\n\\nNumber 1 ), if a customer makes a credit card payment through BoA 's automated system and due to THEIR system updates the payments get rejected, they should PROMPTLY notify the impacted customer 's that their scheduled payments did not apply to their accounts so the customer can either be aware that it was BoA 's fault their system update effectively voided their prompt phone payment or 2 ) reenter the same payment already made by customer so it's applied timely so the customer does not get charged a late fee! The phone banker told me it was not due to factors within my control and that they would reverse the late payment fee, but still this is misleading. I only noticed the ACH payment I made timely through their automated system did not go through when I reviewed my next statement and saw the late fee and previous payment applied back to my balance. This is not the customer 's fault, I made the original payment timely. \\n\\nWhy does not BoA have internal controls in place to identify ACH payments in process that failed due to their system updates/upgrades so they can promptly notify the customer of the need to re-input their payment and to avoid charging them late fees on their statements? I made every good faith effort to pay it on time, the failure was on BoA 's end which is why the phone banker offered to reverse my late fee. Not to mention, the cost of my valuable time having to call BoA, wait 15 minutes to talk to a human being, then press them on why the payment they confirmed on XX/XX/XXXX via email was added back to my account statement on XX/XX/XXXX and inquire why I was charged a late fee when I made my payment timely on XX/XX/XXXX, my time is money!\", 'I redeemed Citi XXXX Rewards points for 2 Home Depot gift cards, {$50.00} and {$100.00}, on XX/XX/XXXX.

The speck of damage is no more than 2mm, and was there when I picked it up. The attendant told me not to worry about it because it was under 1cm. ( Also XXXX XXXX time, XXXX New York time ) I went to do final paperwork with one of the attendants, and saw two of the guys from the car rental agency hover around the speck in question. And 3 minutes later, they asked me to tell them about why I damaged their car. I looked at the damage they pointed to, and it was completely different than the speck that was there just a few minutes ago. THEY DID DAMAGE TO THEIR OWN CAR TO TRY AND MAKE ME PAY FOR IT!!!

I sent them a few pictures and they claim they can not see it. This is complete FRAUD on their part.

The merchant stipulated that the order would ship by late XX/XX/XXXX. Throughout the month of XX/XX/XXXX, I sent several e-mails to the merchant to inquire about the status of my order, but received nothing but automated replies that did not address my concern. On XX/XX/XXXX, after still not receiving my order ( or even any additional details about my order ), I opened a dispute with Citi. Initially, Citi stated that a final decision would be made by XX/XX/XXXX. Within a few days, that date was changed to XX/XX/XXXX. I contacted Citi via their online chat to ask why the date was pushed back, and whether it could be pushed back further. I was told to address that concern with the Citi billing disputes department via e-mail. I sent an e-mail to the address provided, and a second e-mail to the same address 9 days later, but neither e-mail was ever responded to. During this time, the merchant ( XXXX ) sent me an e-mail stating that the order was cancelled and refunded ( as I had previously requested ). Despite this e-mail, it was never refunded by the merchant. Some time after that, I received the ( supposedly cancelled ) order in the mail, so I contacted the merchant, and requested a return. I returned the order with USPS tracking number XXXX. The merchant stated to me that they issued my refund, but I have not received the refund ( I received a \"\" conditional credit \\'\\' from Citi that can be reversed, but no actual refund from the merchant ). To the best of my knowledge, XX/XX/XXXX has not stated to Citi that the merchandise was returned to them, but I did provide Citi with that information, along with the tracking number as proof. In the weeks/months after that point, Citi \\'s deadline was pushed back several more times, first to XX/XX/XXXX, then to XX/XX/XXXX, then to XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was told by Citi via phone that the refund would post by early the following week and would be reflected in my next statement, however that was not the case ( again, I did still have the \"\" conditional credit \\'\\', but there was no final decision in the dispute, or a final refund posted to my account, as promised ). On XX/XX/XXXX I received my statement ( the one I was told would reflect the refund ) and when there was no mention of a refund, I contacted Citi via phone again. This time I was told it may take until XX/XX/XXXX to make a final decision, but definitely no longer than that. I told the Citi associate that I was getting frustrated with all the extended deadlines and would file a formal complaint against Citi with the XXXX XXXX XXXX if the refund was not made/finalized by XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, the date on Citi \\'s website was pushed back yet again to XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, the XXXX  complaint was filed via fax. I called Citi today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and the automated line told me that the credit was now permanent. Wanting confirmation since Citi \\'s website still listed the credit as conditional, I asked for an operator and was eventually connected to the disputes department. The Citi associate I spoke with claimed ( counter to the automated line ) that the credit was not yet permanent, as Citi had not heard from the merchant \\'s bank. I informed the Citi associate that the merchant told me ( via e-mail ) that they would not be in touch with Citi, and I also added that Citi stated on their site that they would give the merchant ( or merchant \\'s bank ) until XX/XX/XXXX to respond and that that date had already passed. The Citi associate did not have any reasonable answer/explaination for that.', 'My card has been taken by the ATM machine, and i need the bank send me a new one to replace.

No contact by either phone or mail was made since then. I noticed around XX/XX/XXXX that the credits issued for the fraudulent purchases were put back on my account. I called to inquire and was told that there is no way for me to speak to the fraud department directly and they would contact me. 2 days later I recieved a fraud affidavit in the mail which I immediately filed out, certified mail and faxed. I did call to confirm receipt but other than that, they have not contacted me in anyway, but still are expecting me to pay the bill which is due in XXXX. I was under the impression that it is illegal for them to require me to pay this until the investigation is completed.

These businesses have distinct addresses that would make it impossible to transact with simultaneously. Not only that, the clothing store does not open until XXXX. Even if they were batched from the weekend I was not in the city of XXXX at any point in recent memory. Capital One confirmed the strangeness of the charges on my initial report, noting the card was used in a chip reader. \\nOn XX/XX/XXXX Capital one reversed the credits provided to me and sent a letter claiming they had performed an investigation and determined NO Fraud took place, further citing they believed me or another account holder may have benefited from the transaction. They provided no corroborating evidence and conducted no interviews either in person or on the phone. This is despite the evidence I provided. \\nThe only claim Capital One asserts is that their chip functions can not be copied or stolen. The claim was said with the same confidence and hubris as the XXXX can not sink when I reported this on XX/XX/XXXX to a customer service agent who then elevated me to a supervisor named XXXX. This is after I was placed on a XXXX minute hold to speak with an agent about the letter on XX/XX/XXXX that was eventually disconnected without speaking to anyone. XXXX, the supervising agent further told me that the investigation was concluded and I could not reopen it. Several minutes later he said if I had documentation to support my claim I could submit it to them and they would evaluate it. Again, his only response to my claims that I did not make the purchases in question was that the chips were impossible to commit fraud with. I asked him for all the information he had on the case to be shared with me. \\nEven confirming the time discrepancy and my assertion that the card was in my possession while I was quarantined at home ( and asleep at XXXX for that matter ) and that one of the businesses was far from the other still did not sway his conviction that fraud was impossible. This flies in the face of their fraud protection guarantees. Even worse, this accuses me of criminal activity in falsely reporting theft and committing credit card fraud myself. The agents I spoke with confirmed the only research performed by the fraud investigators was the above assertion of perfectly secured chips and the fact that I told an agent on the initial fraud call that I had the card in hand at the time of the phone call. Even a hypothetical situation where my card was stolen from my wallet and used, then replaced without my knowledge, still was not enough fraud or impetus to reopen the claim according to their policies. \\nThey did not call the businesses in question ( as I did ), they did not research the legitimacy of the establishments ( as I and XXXX did ), Capital One did not confirm any security camera footage or produce batch receipts from the businesses in question, and they certainly did not conduct a fair and thorough review of my claims. Further insinuating that I improperly benefited from these small transactions and barring me from disputing or appealing their investigators finding is even more troublesome than the initial fraudulent charges. This suggests I am not the only one who has been treated this way. It also suggests gross negligence on behalf of Capital One Bank, a major American financial institution, in dereliction of oversight on commercial credit accounts. They have violated their fraud guarantee and covenant with me and my business.', 'I previously held a Discover credit card in XXXX. The card was closed with a XXXX   balance on XX/XX/XXXX. I filed for Bankruptcy Chapter XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX and it was discharged in XX/XX/XXXX. Discover was never included in the bankruptcy. I was never late with Discover. I never missed a payment and my payments were never returned. \\n\\nApproximately one year later, in XX/XX/XXXX, I applied for a Discover card and was rejected for \"\" STATUS OF EXISTING / PRIOR DISCOVER CARD ACCOUNT. \\'\\' I called customer service and they told me there was nothing they could do because it was showing as a bankruptcy. I supplied information to all the credit bureaus and had the account updated to reflect the correct status : Paying/paid as agreed. Closed by consumer. \\n\\nIn XX/XX/XXXX, I used Discover \\'s pre-approval tool and was denied due to \"\" STATUS OF EXISTING / PRIOR DISCOVER CARD ACCOUNT. \\'\\' Knowing that this was incorrect, I called the customer support team. They told me that my application had been rejected due to my previous card being included in bankruptcy. I informed them this was incorrect, they looked at the data and agreed - sending me up to a supervisor. Eventually, I reached a man named XXXX in a high-up credit reporting department or something of the like. His direct line is XXXX. I spoke with him on and off for two weeks while he worked to get all notations of my bankruptcy removed. Once he verified that it had been corrected, he told me to submit an application. At this point, I had spent no less than 5 hours on the phone with Discover through various stages of this process. \\n\\nOver the next month, I submitted at least 7 different pre-approvals at the suggestion of people in the Acquisitions department and could get no confirmation that my status had been updated. I spent an additional 4 hours on the phone with application specialists, and Acquisition team members trying to find out more information. Trusting what XXXX had told me, I decided to apply again, believing that because my credit reports reflected correctly and I had someone already clean my account of any erroneous reporting, that this would not be an obstacle. \\n\\nI submitted an application on XX/XX/XXXX and received a hard inquiry on my XXXX credit report as a result. The application was rejected solely for the reason of \"\" STATUS OF EXISTING / PRIOR DISCOVER CARD ACCOUNT. \\'\\' I immediately called the application team and asked for a supervisor after explaining my dilemma. She, XXXX, told me that there was nothing she could do about my application or the inquiry - but she did say that she could see that my previous account in Discover \\'s system showed \"\" Bankruptcy \\'\\' for a status, yet she could clearly see that the account was closed before the bankruptcy was filed. She then put me on hold and spoke with the \"\" Bankruptcy \\'\\' Department ( Ph # XXXX ). She transferred me to a woman named XXXX who profusely apologized for the error and said she was forwarding it to her supervisor for immediate correction. XXXX said to call them back in 72 hours and it would be fixed, and then I could apply again. \\n\\nWhen I inquired about her removing the inquiries, she seemed confused and didnt understand that I was asking for the inquiry to be removed since Discover rejected my application based on false information. I said I would like to apply again, but did not think it was fair to receive two hard inquiries simply because of an error Discover had made with their internal systems. \\n\\nAfter getting transferred to her supervisor, it turned out to be XXXX - who I had spent several weeks talking to previously. He apologized profusely for the mistake and said that there was simply an error in the system. He said he submitted to fix it again, but couldnt make any promises about getting the hard inquiry removed. At this point, Discover has taken up more than a full days time from me, to fix an error that should have never been included to begin with. They also have put two hard inquiries on my credit report that were based on factually inaccurate information. \\n\\nSimply put, because I did not have an active account with Discover at the time of bankruptcy, there should never have been any notation applied to my previous account. I have been patient, but this habit of mis-reporting and mislabeling consumer accounts is immoral and should definitely be considered illegal. \\n\\nI have been financially harmed by Discovers refusal to remove a hard inquiry and refusal to manually review the application since it had been rejected based on false information. Discover was put on notice about the misreporting multiple times and their customer service reps could see the illegitimate bankruptcy reporting, yet Discover did nothing about it.\"\\nI was able to get the payments lowered. However, I had lost my job after separating from my spouse leaving me having to get an apartment for my children and myself. I contacted the company with this information that I did not have any incoming money to make payments at that time. I had enough money to pay rent by using my 401k. Then COVID-19 happened and I didnt start work right away. When the divorce was finalized and my lawyer was paid and the house was sold, I went to pay off the card and it no longer showed up for payment. I did not receive any letter indicating the account was sent to collections or the card company was going to send to collections of payment was not received. Now there is a derogatory indicator on my credit report because of the card company failing to work with me in my situation. I planned on paying off the card once the funds were available from the house sale. Therefore ; the information is poorly reported by the card company. At the most a negative report but not derogatory. I didnt refuse to pay I just could t pay at that time. The company was aware of this respectfully.\\n\"To whom it may concern I want to raise this compliant to American Express Membership Reward program.

I believe Capital One has made an error on my account, and I would like to get it corrected. I tried calling you, however, without an extension [ for XXXX XXXX XXXX. ] no one was able to locate you. \\nYour letter of XX/XX/XXXX states the following : When you reported fraud to us on XX/XX/18, I immediately credited youre account for the charges listed below ( XX/XX/18 XXXX XXXX {$910.00} and XXXX ). On XX/XX/18, the merchant credited your account for the same charges. That means your account was charged fraudulently only once, but credited twice. We need to correct this by canceling out the duplicate credits by reapplying the below charges to your account. \\nI acknowledge that credits were applied on XX/XX/XXXX in the above amounts. HOWEVER, MY [ XX/XX/XXXX ] STATEMENT DOES NOT SHOW ANY SECOND CREDIT FROM THE MERCHANT ON XX/XX/XXXX.

These entries are debits to my account and show that you have debited me twice when I was only credited once. \\nThe XX/XX/XXXX Statement shows correctly on XX/XX/XXXX, a charge for {$2300.00} and a corresponding credit for the same amount. You have not charged any other amounts in XX/XX/XXXX. That is how the {$67.00} and the {$910.00} should be treated. \\nPlease credit me back the {$910.00} and the {$67.00}, as you have charged me again for the fraudulent charges. \\nI have called and called and only received a letter from XXXX XXXX dated XX/XX/2018.

When I tried to use my card a couple of weeks later I discovered that apparently did NOT happen, and I was reflecting a past due balance on my account which suspended the ability to use the available credit. I contacted Target on XX/XX/XXXX to see what was happening and was advised by a supervisor that the initial representative I spoke to in XXXX did not enter information correctly, so the update did not get processed correctly. She advised everything had then been corrected, and my account should reflect the changes in 2 business days. \\n\\nAfter a week of waiting a week, I reached out again on XX/XX/XXXX via secure message to inquire about the status of the correction and was told again to call the 800 number on XX/XX/XXXX for details, which I immediately did. The representative I spoke to on XX/XX/XXXX said the representatives I spoke to on XX/XX/XXXX had only requested my late fee be waived but still did not properly make the corrections for my covid-19 hardship so my payment would be updated to {$0.00} due for both XXXX and now for the upcoming XXXX payment and remove the past due hold on my account so I can use the available credit.

I received a Form 1099-C and claimed this charged off debt as income on my XXXX  Federal income taxes. \\n\\nInitially, I could not find the one paper copy of Form 1099-C that I received from Chase Financial. I called Chase Financial on  XX/XX/XXXX to obtain another copy of the Form 1009-C from XXXX. During my phone call, I was transferred from the U.S. call center to a call center in XXXX, and then transferred back to the U.S. During this phone call, I was asked to provide my Social Security Number and date of birth multiple times to prove my identity. Despite all of this information, Chase Financial was unwilling and unable to provide me with an electronic copy of my XXXX Form 1099-C. I was asked to write a letter to their home office in Delaware, provide my original Chase account number ( which I no longer have ), my  Social Security Number, and my date of birth. Their sheer intransigence and excuses in this matter were quite frustrating. I was a XXXX employee in the past, and my information was hacked during the XXXX XXXX data breach. As you can imagine, I am protective of my Personal Identifying Information ( PII ).  Given the prevalence of electronic records, Chase Financial should have been able to e-mail me an electronic copy of the XXXX Form 1099-C within 48 hours. I am furious that Chase Financial continues to avoid operating at 21st century electronic records requirements. \\n\\nIf you need to speak with me, I can be contacted on my cell phone : ( XXXX ) XXXX. My email address is : XXXX, if you would prefer to use email. Thank you for your assistance. \\n\\nSincerely, cc : Representative XXXX XXXX Senator XXXX XXXX XXXX Senator XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX', 'Hello, Please note that my selection showing that I am having issues with getting a working replacement card was the closest to my concern but not my exact issue. My issue is that I consented and applied for a credit card and the card issued to me was sent with the wrong last name. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/2018, at XXXX, I responded to an offer Discover card sent in my correct name by phone. Attached is the invitation showing the correct name, address with invitation number leading to my approval and a screen shot showing I called to apply since they are claiming I applied my mail and the online. Id like them to pull the call on 10h for  review for coaching and training purposes. \\n\\nThis offer was simply to apply for credit card and the entire process took less than 15mins. I remember the representative asking my name so he could address me during our conversation but I dont recall any questions about my name during that application process it self. Discover card has made a huge error, violated me by placing an incorrect name on the card they sent me. Ive spend hours being bounced around their departments with no one admitting they made an error, lack of listening or verification prior to the issuance of my credit card and not issuing a card in my correct name. I was told to send documentation of legal name change when I never gave them the wrong name to start with. To me its a fd up way to begin a relationship in which I thought was a good move with them and here we are with nonsense. I wanted to avoid the hassle and figured Id look for documents from years ago to satisfy this issue but I have spent additional personal time in an attempt to locate documents i have not used in over 6 or 7 years. Unfortunately, I cant find the document of name change at this time as a result of just moving into a new house. Here I am stuck with this issue without my documents and I need them to correct this huge error without causing additional impact to my credit. I was told by a rep that they can just close the card and reapply like its nothing and I feel that people who say such things have or dont know the value of avoiding credit inquiries and how much of an impact it has. I have not provided additional consent to review my credit beside the time I applied so there should be no addition inquiry including any soft pulls on my credit. they had their chance to look at my credit profile, which I believe they did when they approved me and should have had the correct last name at that time. I have bought 3 cars, applied with other financial institutions and purchased 2 homes since my name change and Ive had no issues. So why Discover? How come they have the right to make a mistake and then pry into my personal life? when I called in an attempt to resolve this issue, I found out that they dont have a way to track how the application was taken, I was told, I applied with paper by mail which was incorrect, then another rep told me I applied online and filled the application myself which was also incorrect. The last rep told me it was an assumption that Discover doesnt have a way to track how applications are taken. What? This is a huge risk to consumer and hate to say but a risk for their financial institutions. How can a huge financial institution like this not have valid records of an application process and then choose to place an incorrect name on my card and leave it up to me to fix it. This is the similar nonsense that got wellsfargo in Trouble to begin with!!!! I dont feel that Discover has any legal right to the documentation showing I had a name change from about 7 years ago as they are requesting. i feel this is a violation of my rights and no one seems to care that they made an error or willingly fix the problem. Again, This is their mistake and they should internally fix this problem by sending me my XXXX XXXX card with the correct last name, an apology and admittance of this issue and compensation for all the wasted time Ive spent dealing with their error.', \"On XX/XX/XXXX, I purchased a {$2000.00} Camera on XXXX. \\nThe camera was never delivered although tracking showed XXXX delivered the package to my front door. \\nThere was no signature confirmation from me and I expected they required that for such a high ticket item. \\nI reached out to XXXX & the seller. The seller just stated that his tracking showed the item was delivered so he created a dispute within XXXX. \\nAt that point I needed a camera so I called my credit card company to see what they could do. I told them that my tracking showed delivered through XXXX, but the item was not received. They told me not to worry about it and that they would issue a provisional credit and get it resolved. \\nA month later I received a call stating that my chargeback was denied and funds were withdrawn out of my account again. They stated XXXX presented sufficient evidence that item was received. When I received the details, all ebay sent was a tracking number stating that the item was delivered. That was the reason I called Barclays in the first place. From there I kept calling and the Barclay reps kept telling me to send in letters explaining the situation to try to re-open the case. After 3 letters they just kept telling me they couldn't re-open it. They told me I needed to handle it through XXXX XXXX XXXX. When I reached out to XXXX & XXXX they stated that since I opened a chargeback, their hands were tied. Had I kept the dispute with ebay open and avoided the chargeback, XXXX would have been able to take care of me as they require signature confirmation for anything over {$700.00}. I called Barclays back to explain the situation and how this could have been avoided had the Barclays rep told me initially that my claim would be denied if I had a tracking number which shows delivered. They gave me the same answer so I had it escalated to a supervisor. Days later a supervisor from Barclays called me back and I got her and XXXX on the phone together for a resolution. No resolution was met and ultimately both parties stated that there wasn't anything they could do. I feel that Barclays & their poor policies have stolen {$2000.00} from me. XXXX & XXXX at least were very upfront with their policies from the start, instead of trying to please the customer and then later taking back their word. This is a large amount of money and I am so upset that after almost 4 months, nothing is resolved.\", \"This complaint is a follow up regarding a complaint # XXXX filed on cfpb. \\n\\nThe original complaint was regarding a dispute detailed below. \\n\\nMy laptop was stolen last year and someone used my information to book two flights from two different cities headed to the same destination.

Clearly, i couldnt have flown from two different cities to the same destination. later, the airline also confirmed that i never took benefited from those flights. chase asked me for a bunch of documents and i provided all the documents including the police report for the stolen laptop, proof that the flights were booked under my name. however, the date of births used to book the flights were not mine.

We scheduled the earliest available XXXX service tech appointment for diagnosis and repair, which would be a few days later XX/XX/XXXX - we filed a repair/extended warranty claim with Citi 's Benefits department. The refrigerator was past 1 year old so the manufacturer warranty no longer applied, and it is still in the period that Citi covered with its warranty. We also called Citi to confirm the extended warranty applied ( 14 minute phone call ) XX/XX/XXXX - the XXXX service tech diagnosed the refrigerator as being a total and complete failure which included a contamination of the sealed system. The problems he diagnosed are considered unable to be fixed, and he said the refrigerator would need to be entirely replaced. \\nAfter this diagnosis, we submitted the following information to Citi 's benefits department : XXXX warranty terms, receipt of purchase, the XXXX service tech 's diagnosis, and photos of the refrigerator. This also included a phone call to Citi to confirm these were the documents they needed ( 19 minute phone call ) XX/XX/XXXX - we called for an update on our case, we were told it was still under review and that the adjuster had not looked at the case ( 4 minute phone call ) XX/XX/XXXX - we called again for an update on our case, we were told it was still under review and that the adjuster had not looked at the case ( 4 minute phone call ) XX/XX/XXXX - we called a third time for an update and were told that our claim was denied ; we had not been notified of this until we called to check for an update. My wife called twice ; her first call was disconnected after being on hold ( 10 minutes ), her second call ( 17 minute phone call ) determined that the reason for the denial was that the adjuster claimed that the refrigerator was still under the XXXX warranty. This is FALSE - the adjuster did not read the warranty document clearly and used the warranty duration for a XXXX Profile refrigerator, which is NOT our model of refrigerator. A third call from me ( 24 minutes ) did not provide any additional information or assistance into the incorrect decision from the adjuster. In order to have the adjuster ( XXXX ) review the claim again, she required us to submit more documentation proving that the warranty document we submitted ( which was pulled directly from Home Depot 's website ) matched our refrigerator for the 1 year warranty part.

Furthermore, XXXX XXXX must have not provided a bill receipt either because CITI never provided proof that I approved this charge. I have tried to call XXXX XXXX to get a receipt but I get automated response that because of high call volumes by call can not be completed. I am perplexed how CITI takes the word of a merchant without proof over their own customers. I have attached the only email I received from XXXX XXXX for this purchase. I also attached a receipt from a previous purchase to demonstrate what I should have received or CITI should have requested before settling this dispute.\\n\"I currently have a XXXX XXXX American Express card that is assessing me a {$450.00} annual fee with a {$1000.00} credit limit. The annual fee is 45 % of the credit limit, therefore a violation of the credit card act of 2009 that requires fee \\'s not exceed 25 % of a cards limit in the first year.', 'Good Day, My name is XXXX. A while back I took a balance transfer offer from Citibank. I transferred roughly {$4300.00} to a zero interest diamond preferred card. As of XX/XX/XXXX, I had paid that balance down to {$1800.00}. \\n\\nI receive social security XXXX and my husband gets paid bi-weekly. So, I figured that he had 9 paydays left until XXXX, which is the date that zero interest promotion expires and I had 5 XXXX payments coming. So, after doing the math, it came out to 5 payments of {$140.00} a month from me and {$120.00} per pay check from him. I set my online banking to send these payments automatically so I wouldn\\'t forget. \\n\\nThen at the end of XXXX before the expiration date, I intended to double check that it was pif and pay anything that was left outstanding so as to avoid any deferred interest. \\nThe deferred interest is a significant amount. It would be somewhere between $ XXXX {$900.00}. So, I felt it was very important to get it paid on time. \\n\\nIn the meantime, Citibank offered me another promotional balance transfer, which I accepted. This one has a very small interest rate, less than 1 % and it doesn\\'t expire until XX/XX/XXXX. So, I am figuring that I will take care of that one after I finish the one thats due by XXXX. \\n\\nI wrote Citibank a letter in XXXX explaining that I want my payments targeted to the oldest bill, in other words, the one that expires on XXXX. \\n\\nNow, its XXXX. I am reviewing bills and such and I see that the promotional balance which expires on XXXX has not decreased nearly as much as I expected it to with the payments I have made. I realize that they have been putting the payments toward the promotional balance that expires on XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nI have XXXX , and it has affected my speech. I don\\'t like speaking on the phone, so I open a chat with \"\" XXXX \\'\\'. After explaining all this to XXXX she basically tells me that Citibank applies any payment above the minimum toward whichever promotion has the higher interest rate. \\n\\nI can\\'t believe that\\'s true. That I have no control over how they apply my payment. So, I call and speak to \"\" XXXX \\'\\' and she tells me the same thing. Lastly I speak to a supervisor, XXXX XXXX She also told me the same thing. So the bottom line is that in order to avoid paying all that back interest on that zero interest promotion not only would I need to pay it in full, but I would need to pay the other one in full also because no matter what I ask for they are going to put my money toward the promotion that expires on XX/XX/XXXX first because it charges interest. \\n\\nWhen I asked the supervisor where this information was disclosed she told me it was given to me verbally when I transferred the balance. First off, I did this all online. I did not speak to anyone. When she finally realized that I didn\\'t do this promotional offer over the phone, she told me it was disclosed on the website but, she could not tell me where. She offered to send me a letter. I don\\'t need a letter after the fact. \\n\\nI want a copy of what I agreed to when I took this promotion specifically where it says how the payments will be posted and that I have no control over how I want my money applied. \\n\\nIdeally I want to be able to finish paying the zero interest promotional balance by XX/XX/XXXX and then pay off the other promotional balance by its due date of XX/XX/XXXX. If I am not given the opportunity to do it that way, I guess I will have to transfer both promotions to a different zero interest card and go from there. In that case, I want citibank to provide me documentation that I agreed to this method of payment application or I want the transfer fees that I originally paid refunded. \\n\\nThank you for your help with this matter. \\n\\nSincerely, XXXX', \"I opened a business credit card with US Bank on XX/XX/XXXX where the terms were that if a spending threshold of {$4500.00} was met within the first 150 days, a bonus would be given valued at {$500.00}. \\n\\nHaving tracked my spending with the tool provided by US Bank ( Spend Analyzer tool ), I believed that i had met the spending threshold on the credit card before the expiry date.

After looking into it, they told me that there were some credits applied to my account that thus didnt count towards the spend requirement, even though these credits are in no way reflected in the spend analyzer tool. So in theory, one could spend {$10000.00} in purchases on the card, and let 's say you returned {$9000.00} worth of the merchandise due to a defect. Well, in their own tool, that {$9000.00} would be unaccounted ( there is no mention anywhere that refunds/credits are not captured in the tool ) and the 'analysis ' of your spending would show that you spent {$10000.00} on the card. \\n\\nI told US Bank that I thought this was misleading since they advertise this tool as an accurate accounting of transactions on the card, and was basically dismissed.

I thought this was very sensitive information to request and so I called to verify and they stated it was correct. I went ahead and mailed this sensitive information priority mail and called every other day to verify they received it because of how highly sensitive this information was. After 3 weeks from the time I mailed these documents, their mailing department put a note on the account stating they finally processed my information. I was told at that time over the phone that my application would be approved. 7 days later I received another letter stating my identity could not be confirmed. I attempted to call and no one from that department would speak to me to give me more information as to what was going on. I sent highly sensitive information and received NO COMMUNICATION except letters thru snail mail which did not provide proper information. The letter only stated if I wanted to contact them back to write them another letter thru snail mail. I do so and yet again I have heard nothing. I called today and now they are stating my application is closed because it is over 30 days which doesn\\'t make any sense since everything has been on THEIR time and NO COMMUNICATION except random snail mail letters. I requested the company if they are not going to follow procedures then I want the hard credit report inquiry to be removed and my sensitive documents to be mailed back to me as they should not keep those records. This company needs to be reviewed on how they are handling applications, documents, and communication with consumers. My application should have never been closed due to identity as if there was any issues them their department should have contacted me with any questions. My address on my license has my previous home that I sold in XXXX ( which shows on my credit report ) and the bill I sent in with the documents showed my current address ( which also shows on my credit report ).

Month after month I called and they refused. XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with XXXX, who told me as XX/XX/XXXX Discover card charged off the account. She went on to say she would be glad to take a payment but could not discuss the account. She said once given permission they would discuss options. She was asked why take a payment now that the account is charged off - when this could have been avoided had they taken the payment months ago, month after month. XXXX - permission was received to speak with my mother regarding the account. She explained he situation - stated she wanted to make the payments have the account reinstated and my credit history updated because it was not like we were not attempting to make the payments - DISCOVER was refusing to take them until the account charged off. XXXX, who said the account was charged off. XX/XX/XXXX spoke with XXXX XXXX - manager who said it was charged off and that was it all we could do is pay and nothing else. XX/XX/XXXX called Discover and XXXX to XXXX, who confirmed that XX/XX/XXXX Discovered refused payment it was documented in the system. He went on to say that the policy changed and they can now accept payment. It was explained to him that if that is the case then the account and the account holder should be made whole. He went on to say he did not see any calls regarding the account. It was explained to him that the regular number was called. XX/XX/XXXX - explained to XXXX we wanted to set the account on autopay and have the account reinstated remove late charges and have credit to no longer reflect negative due to them not accepting payments. XXXX said once charged off they were not taking it back and we could dispute it with XXXX - She said balance was XXXX could settle for XXXX and it still show negative on the account. \\nXXXXThey wanted us to accept a settlement but did not want to send it out for us to review. XXXX said we had to verbally accept it first then they could sent it out. We explained that we should be able to review to see if it is in my best interest first. She said she could not do that. Discover stood in the way of this account being maintained successfully. Although, my son was not able to make payment he had someone willing to pay the card, not get information, or any thing additional about the account simply pay money and they refused it. Now they want to charge off the account and negatively impact his credit.

However, also on XX/XX/XXXX, WF put a FALSE AND FRAUDULENT debit charge on the card of {$4600.00}, which I had NOT incurred and which they labelled a \"\" payment adjustment \\'\\', so that the card appeared to have a \"\" balance \\'\\' ( owing ) of {$4200.00} even though there actually was no balance owing at all. Since then, I have phoned them repeatedly, spoken to multiple Reps and multiple Supervisors on recorded lines.

I then spoke to her Supervisor XXXX who told me that though she agreed ( looking at the record ) that I didn\\'t owe WF any money and the {$4200.00} \"\" balance owing \\'\\' they had on my account was in ERROR, she couldn\\'t do anything about it ; XXXX said SHE would also send another Complaint to Corporate, and XXXX told me that she could request for me a temporary \"\" COVID19 \\'\\' waiver of both minimum payments AND any interest charges on any unpaid balance, so that\\'s what I did.

I reserved the room but no link for the credit card appeared. This was on XX/XX/XXXX. That day and over the next week I made multiple phone calls about the offer and was directed to Chase by the XXXX people and then to XXXX by Chase people. Finally on about XX/XX/XXXX I got a gentleman from Chase on the phone. I had printed out the summary page for my records and I photographed it and sent it to him. He then advised me to cancel the reservation and then to remake it which I did. He then took me step by step through the application process but it came up for the one that requires you to spend {$5000.00} and get miles. The one that had gotten me to apply had the {$200.00} statement credit & waived the {$95.00} fee for one year. When I mentioned this to him again ( I had led with this when he first picked up ) he stated that once I had applied and was approved he would go in ( to the computer I assume ) and get the offer I was referring to. I of course wasn\\'t wild about that as I noted that it would be a week or so before I was notified by mail and he advised that was correct but that he could go in right away to check. As my credit score is between 805 & 815 depending on the agency I foresaw no problems and was shocked when he got back on and advised I had been turned down for the card. As obviously if there was no card there was no offer I thanked him and waited quite curiously for notification of why I was turned down. Lo and behold, last week I got the card in the mail, obviously I was not turned down. I made sure I would qualify for the offer I had for the card that day or the day after by making a small charge and called Chase the next day and again told them the exact story I am relating to you and offered to send them the pix of the Summary Page that I had previously sent to their phone employee. They declined, and after speaking to a supv they refused to honor the offer insisting instead on the {$5000.00} charge for miles which I had no interest in. Then lo and behold I received a bill almost immediately for the $ 50+ purchase I had made and Chase had added on the XXXX XXXX XXXXearly charge which of course was waived under the offer that lured me in. I again called and again Chase refused to honor their original offer insisting I applied for the other offer which I have to admit is technically true as I did so under the guidance of their employee who was supposedly going to rectify the situation but instead falsely claimed my application had been denied. This is where we presently stand. As far as I am concerned this is a classic case of bait & switch.

It was already late, so I checked the tracking and delivery to locate the item and saw that it was already delivered! I thought this was a mistake because I did not receive it and saw that there was no delivery attempt notice that I missed with my resident manager. Unsure of how to proceed, I requested for a refund as soon as I could because I suspected that my order delivery was botched or lost. I called XXXX Billing Department about this and, following a script, they tell me is that they see that the package was delivered to my address already, and to file a police report with local law enforcement -- with no sympathy nor responsibility to take further action on their end. Needless to say, they were no help and I\\'m growing anxiously frustrated at their disregard for my situation and lack of customer care. Naive as I was, I gave XXXX the benefit of the doubt and waited another week before taking further action in hopes that my package is just delayed. \\n\\nAround XX/XX/XXXX, I have still not received the XXXX XXXX that I ordered and paid for. At this point I\\'m really upset, angry, and confused. I speak to XXXX \\'s rep and they tell me that they will not be able to do anything else unless I file a police report. That\\'s ridiculous!

After I attempt to make the transfer my card was block from any further purchases and the {$1400.00} never deposit into my XXXX  XXXX  account. I awaited numerous days and currently still waiting and nothing.

When I told her I could pay {$400.00} on XXXX XXXX, she proceeded to offer me only 48 days after just. She then quickly offered a longer plan that cost interest over the long term. I feel this was a bait and switch praying on those in need with Covid-19. \\n\\nAfter this attempt to arrange payment, they started calling me with disconnected calls throughout the day and also after XXXX at night. At XXXX on XX/XX/2020 I received a call from XXXX from a person who I could not understand his name, all I could make out is he was from American Express . I asked if he was a debt collector attempting to collect a debt and he refused to answer stating only that he was from American Express. I informed him the law prevented him from calling this late at night and that it was XXXX at night. The following night again at XXXX on XX/XX/2020 they called again refusing to identify as a debt collector. I identified that it was XXXX and they were violating federal law. That night they called again at XXXX on XX/XX/2020 again not identifying themselves as debt collectors.

I declined and ask that XXXX ensure their call logs for the phone calls that violated federal law not be destroyed. By the conversation, it appears they still did not have my number labeled as an EST time zone. XXXX said, \"\" I have raised a complaint from my end and the team will work to stop the calls post XXXX EST. \\'\\' This leads me to believe they will continue the harassment and have no regard for me other than trying to collect a little extra on the account. \\n\\nI am requesting action be taken because of the violations ... \\nHarrasment : repeatedly use the phone to annoy you', \"While reviewing my XX/XX/XXXX XXXX credit card statement which is issued by Comenity Capital Bank, I observed an unauthorized charge on the amount of {$390.00} from XXXX XXXX XXXX.

After filing the dispute i waited about 3 weeks to find out the status of the dispute and at the time I learned that the dispute was not filed by the bank. \\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I filed again a dispute for the same aforementioned charge and this time the dispute was filed. Since the bank 's policy is 30 days to investigate the dispute and to give a resolution I called them back on XX/XX/XXXX to follow up on my dispute and at that time I was told that they were still investigating the dispute to call back in a couple of weeks. \\nOn or about XX/XX/XXXX I called the bank again to check about my account and the answer is the same, we are still investigating. \\nAfter that called I being calling almost every 2 to 3 weeks .and the answer is still the same. \\nThe bank has violated their credit card agreement as their agreement clearly states that in 30 days the disputes will be resolved.

If I make purchases on the Revolving Charge Portion of my account I get charged interest even if I pay off those charges before the STATEMENT DUE DATE of the statement on which those charges appear. I talked to XXXX  ( agent number XXXX ) on XX/XX/2020 just before noon. He stated that any purchases must be paid off by the STATEMENT CLOSING DATE in order to avoid paying interest. This STATEMENT CLOSING DATE occurs before I have even received the statement in the mail. The STATEMENT CLOSING DATE is generally about 3-4 weeks before the STATEMENT DUE DATE. The problem is that this method of charging interest is contrary to every other credit card that I use, or have used, or ever heard of in my entire lifetime. I feel that this is a scam purposely devised to deceive users into having to always pay interest. I called Synchrony Bank many times previous to XX/XX/2020, and expressed that my purpose was to always avoid paying interest. All of these times that I called Synchrony \\'s method of calculating interest was never explained to me. On XX/XX/2020, a customer service rep even removed the interest charge on my XX/XX/XXXX statement, apologizing for any inconvenience, but not really explaining that the method of calculating interest had caused my problem. I stated on that date, and in previous conversations with customer service, that my sole intent was to avoid paying any interest on the Revolving portion of my account, and that I try to pay off my Revolving Balance every month. As it is, I have to call Synchrony every month in order to separately allocate portions of my total payment to my revolving charge, because if I don\\'t call, there is no possible way to apply the total payment to my revolving balance, as opposed to my promotional balance which does not incur interest every month. I feel that this is another deceptive practice by Synchrony, because Synchrony purposely will apply a payment to a Promotional balance, which does not incur interest charges until after 6 or more months, before it applies payments to a Revolving balance, which does incur daily interest charges. This is also contrary to the method that other credit cards, like XXXX XXXX, use to apply payments to revolving and promotional balances. \\nOn XX/XX/XXXX customer service rep XXXX refused to make adjustments in the interest charge on my XX/XX/XXXX statement, saying he was not allowed to do so, even though a previous customer service rep had done so on XX/XX/XXXX for the previous statement. He also tried to abruptly close our conversation saying that there were too many people in the queue behind me, and refused to pass me on to a manager or give me any other contact information in order to escalate my complaint. \\nTo sum up : Any purchases that I make on this card will ALWAYS incur interest, as it is pretty impossible to pay them off before the STATEMENT CLOSING DATE. I would have to pay each purchase on the card the day after I made the charge in order to avoid paying interest?

Each check was made out directly to each creditor and placed into their separate company envelopes. I walked them down to a US post office locked mailbox outside my office building. I work in a very busy office building with many different businesses and outside is a Us post office mailbox as well as a XXXX lock box. Two weeks went by so I reached out to both creditors to make sure they received the payment which at that time they had not. I contacted discover and was told that yes the checks were processed on XX/XX/XXXX. I immediately became concerned because I had just put them in the lock box a day or two before, the timing was concerning. I then reached out to both XXXX XXXX and XXXX to start an investigation. I went thru all of the necessary procedures with all three creditors to find out what had happened to the checks. I finally received copies of both the checks that had been cashed and I again immediately became concerned because the checks were signed and cashed by the same person on XX/XX/XXXX apparently to a chase banking acct. I immediately contacted Discover and explained the situation, at this point every person I spoke to didn\\'t really seem to care or were concerned. I stressed on every conversation that I believed the checks were fraudulently cashed by some unknown person and each time my concerns were never taken seriously. I filed a case with the post office case # XXXX and I was told by the postoffice that yes there had been some incidence in our area where the mailboxes had been tapered with. I explained that also to every person I spoke to from discover again no one I spoke to seemed to care. I also told them that my boss had a check that was taken and cashed fraudulently from the same mailbox on or around the same time and again no one really seemed to care and in fact XXXX told me it appears that my office had an issue. I again explained to her that all mail gets walked down by me and dropped into a US post office lock box! I was instructed by XXXX that I needed to go to the nearest XXXX XXXX since that is where the checks were cashed and get a copy of source of receipt. My Husband and I on a Thursday XX/XX/XXXX drove 50 miles to the nearest XXXX XXXX to be told by the Bank manager that they could not help us that Discover needed to contact XXXX directly to resolve the issue. We called XXXX while we where in XXXX XXXX. She proceeded to argue with the branch manager stating that he needed to give us the information in regards to the account where the checks were cashed. The Branch manager had to explain to her how the procedure worked and that Discover needed to do an investigation directly with XXXX. My Husband and I were sitting in the middle of this very uncomfortable and inappropriate interaction from XXXX. The branch manager at XXXX was very apoligetic and couldn\\'t believe the misinformation given to us. I contacted Discover that Monday XX/XX/19 and spoke to a superviser and found out that not one of the customer representatives had taken down correct notes. I had to again explain the entire story. She had no knowledge that the checks were placed into a secure lock mailbox once she realized what I had been stating I was finally transferred to the fraud Dept where I spoke to a XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/19. At this point he closed my acct so they could investigate the fraud claim. I then received a letter on XX/XX/19 asking for additional information I called and spoke to first XXXX then XXXX on XX/XX/19 and once again had to explain the entire story because the notes were not entered correctly. I also filled out the attached form and mailed it from my home to Discover. I just received a letter dated XX/XX/19 that they had concluded their investigation and found no fraud and I am responsible for the {$2600.00}. I immediately called and spoke to XXXX on XX/XX/19 and had to give him the post office claim # because once again no one had included that information into the investigation. He explained to me that it would go back to the disputes department but that the charge would still go onto my account and that there was nothing else they could do. This has been so stressful and time consuming, the customer service has been horrible. I have done everything to try to have someone take my concerns seriously and catch the person who committed this act of fraud.\\n\"Re : JP Morgan/Chase Credit Card Services Chase Sapphire Preferred Card I am in legal and legitimate possession of a CHASE SAPPHIRE PREFERRED Credit Card.

Travel providers were advising all trips scheduled for at least 90 days must be rescheduled. When I learned of this, I cancelled all my XXXX travel plans. Fortunately, the airline and cruise providers were understanding and made the appropriate changes. Unfortunately, the hotel in XXXX refused to reimburse my payment. \\nI notified Chase Card Services ( via an on-line web form XX/XX/XXXX ) of the hotel cancellation and requested reimbursement under the Chase Sapphire Card Travel Benefit. After several days of no response I contacted them again. \\nI was notified the request had been denied for the following reason : Cancelling due to the threat of contracting a virus or illness is not eligible for coverage. \\nI responded I did not cancel the trip except for the XXXX closure, and thus, in effect, the airline and the cruise line cancelled my trip. I re-submitted my request hoping that it may have only been a need to clarify the reason. \\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, a Chase Sapphire Card representative provided this response : If a travel supplier cancels for you to be eligible under your benefit they would have to cancel for severe weather or a strike affecting public transportation. \\nI pointed out the reason they gave was in the Trip Interruption section, NOT the Trip Cancellation section and responded the trip was not Interrupted but Cancelled due to international restrictions on non-essential travel ( as it related to the COVID 19 outbreak ). \\nI then appealed their decision and received the following reply from Chase : We have completed our reconsideration of your claim under the Trip Cancellation/Interruption benefit. We regret that we can not process a payment for your claim. Your claim does not qualify for this benefit because : Government travel restrictions resulting in the cancellation of the scheduled cruise is not a covered loss under your Trip Cancellation/Interruption Benefit. Please refer to the Covered Losses section in your Guide to Benefits for confirmation that this incident does not meet the criteria. \\nI asked for clarification as to where this clause resides in the Trip Cancellation Terms and Conditions but did not receive a reply. I again appealed the decision, this time through a telephone conversation placed with Chases Customer Service Department XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ). \\nTheir response this time was the benefit had been denied because the cancelled trip was due to an epidemic or pandemic. \\nI made the point that their terms and conditions do not specifically state the Cancellation benefit is not paid for an epidemic or pandemic.

All other credit cards were approved however Citibank denied the credit card because there were too many inquiries on my credit report. I explained this to Citibank and said that this reason was never mentioned anywhere at the time of my application that if there are multiple inquiries on the same day the card would be rejected even when the credit score is very good. This is misleading the applicant and also negatively impacting their credit record. Citibank should clearly indicate in their application process and not just say that it will be determined after the the credit score.

It allowed me to use my credit card line of credit to obtain cash to pay off other credit cards. I used one of the checks included and deposited it in my Bank. I used the money to pay off my higher credit cards. On the Band of America credit card statements, I noticed that I am being charged a 21 % rate instead of the promised .99 % rate so I called the company to resolve the issue but I was told that the checks can only be used for balance transfer and they need to be directly used to pay off the credit cards. I looked at the BoA offer and it clearly stated that I can use it for anything I want in step 1 of the 1-2-3 easy-access advertisement.

I spoke to the company once before and found out that they had reversed the charge. The company charged my card after 3 months and this time went to fraud. The person ask me questions that were not appropriate such as do you have family members that steal from you? Do you give the credit card to someone else? Did I have plaster or work done on my home? The asked if I had any loans that I applied for or credit cards. In addition, the representative was going to ask more about my personal details and I advised them I was calling about a incident that I am being charged that I was told was closed. The company replaced the card due to the breach and now I had a customer service agent accuse me indirectly that I have a charge that they can ask my whole financial history. My request was simple where did the money get deposited and to whom did the money get deposited. They didn\\'t have any of the information it was a one sided discussion where the company wanted to charge me and not look into it even though it has been over 60 days since it has been closed. The company had to send me a check for overpayment. This shows up as a new charge on the card. I have asked for the supporting documents and the company has provided none. They are overstepping their rights under the Fair Credit Reporting rights in addition the representative was rude.\\nHello. Synchrony Bank closed my cards, sent me a letter stating they closed all my accounts due to them, under the prediction I would, not be able to pay my bill.

When I opened this credit card, I was promised that I would get XXXX renewal hotel bonus points once I have paid {$75.00} annual fee. For year of XXXX, I paid {$75.00} annual fee on XX/XX/XXXX, but I have never received my renewal bonus hotel points. The annual fee is due for XXXX, but I paid my annual fee one month late due to the fact that I didn\\'t receive my credit card statement either by mail or email. \\n\\nI have been calling them since late XX/XX/XXXX and early this year, every time when I called their customer service, I was told that they would investigate and get my renewal points back. However, I called and spoke to one customer service representative and two supervisors, I was told that I will NOT get my annual renewal bonus due to being past due for the annual membership fee. When I applied this credit card, I was told that I will get my renewal bonus points as long as I pay my annual fee. \\n\\nAlso, when I tried to cancel this credit card, I was told that they can cancel my credit card, but I will not get my annual fee back. I was told that it\\'s too late to get my annual fee back, but the fact is that every time when I called, I was told not to worry about my renewal bonus and they will issue my renewal bonus the coming month. If they told me I can\\'t get my renewal bonus in late XXXX or XXXX, I would just go ahead to cancel this credit card at that time. I think they have been cheating, making false promise and having me to wait months after months. \\n\\nI have owned several credits cards from different banks or issuers, I believe U.S Bank is the only bank that try to do everything including cheating and fraud practice to gain at the expense of customer \\'s loss. In this case, I got nothing for having paid U.S. Bank {$75.00} renewal fee. I can\\'t get my annual fee back even if I would like to cancel this credit card. \\n\\nI would like the help from your agency to help get my renewal bonus points back or get my annual fee back if they can\\'t give me any renewal bonus points.\"\\nInk from Chase credit card.

My bookkeeper is working on my books for XXXX and noticed that the {$9500.00} was never deposited to any of my accounts. XX/XX/XXXX My bookkeeper and I called Chase and asked to get a copy of the front and back of the check to see who endorsed the back and where it was deposited to and they said they couldn\\'t give us that information.Our first phone call the Chase employee said they couldn\\'t hear us talking anymore and hung up on us, we called back and asked for a supervisor. The next Chase employee said the supervisors were in a meeting and that he would try to help us. We told him what happened on the first call and he was nice and tried to help us. In the end he said he couldn\\'t get that information for us that we\\'d have to call the dispute department, they would have more details on the transaction. We called the dispute department which was a 50 minute hold time without success. They said they could not give us this information. I don\\'t know if I dropped the check on the way to the bank and someone else cashed it or the bank didn\\'t put it in the my checking account.

I was told the fraudulent charges would be removed and it would be \"\" investigated \\'\\'. I called many times over a period of over 3 months. Amex decided that although the card was used fraudulently, and the man was convicted of fraud by local police for taking this card and shopping with it, and the man is in prison because of this, they decided they would not remove the charges or the interest accruing over these months on the amount, and that we must pay for all of the fraudulent charges. The reason given was that this employee had been given the card previously and authorized to use it to put gas in a vehicle for company use. Any previous authorized use was authorized, and paid. Not the same thing as stealing it and identity theft, for which he has been convicted. These charges are fraud, and under the terms Amex states for it\\'s cards, any fraudulent charges will be removed.', 'In approximately XX/XX/XXXX, I opened a credit card account with Synchrony Bank to cover sewer repairs for my home.

When I paid my bill on XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed that the balance had doubled from {$4000.00} to over {$8000.00}. When I called to inquire why, I was told the interest had been added to the account because the promotional interest rate had expired. \\n\\nMy issue is... I never received any communication from the company ; never received a statement nor a credit card since taking out the loan. Had I received any statements from the company, I would have known the promotion was expiring, and based on my excellent credit rating, I would have transferred the loan to a personal loan and not accrued the over {$4000.00} interest that negated all the payments made for 1.5 years that lowered the remaining balance to half of the loan amount. \\n\\nWhen I called on XX/XX/XXXX and was connected to a manager, I was told I had activated a card that I have never, to this day, received and that I enrolled in electronic statements, which I did not and also have never received by email. Based on the fact that I would have had to activate both the card and electronic statements, and I did not, it should not be hard to prove that I did not activate nor receive the statements nor credit card. When I expressed this to the manager and informed him that, if calls are recorded, as they claim, their should be proof that I did not call to activate a card. Additionally, there should be a record of the initial call that I received to be informed that the first payment was due because I never received a statement to inform me. When I relayed this to the manager, he hung up on me. \\n\\nI called back and tried to speak to a different manager who told me the same thing -- that I had activated both actions -- upon which time I informed him I would be filing a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. \\n\\nI simply want the interest charge reversed, at which time I can transfer the loan to a personal loan and be done with Synchrony Bank.', \"None of your choices applied to this. \\nWhen I make a purchase with my visa or mastercard my money is taken from my account immediately.

The Cash of {$6600.00} was handed over and he began to off load my belongings. Keep in mind I paid $ XXXX and was told I needed 2- 40ft containers and 1-20ft container to move all of my things. He off loaded and only delivered 1/8 of my belongings and told me to sign the contract that states I had received all of my belongings in full. I refused to do so and asked where are the rest of my stuff was. He said that\\'s all that he had and I must sign the contract to finalize and close out the contract. I refused and he tried to force to to sign the document. I told him I will not sign it and I will be calling the police. He left my property as soon as I told him that I will calling the police for help. \\nAt this point, I called the main office for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX and talked to the main point of contact personal named XXXX. I had informed her what took place and that I only received 1/8 of my things and want to know where the rest of my stuff was. She was surprised that I didn\\'t receive everything and told me she will get back to me. couple day later. XXXX told me not to worry and that my things were safe in XXXX  XXXX and ready to ship out on the next shipment. We waited and waited and every time they had a different excuse for not delivering out belongings.After the deadline of delivery date pasted on XX/XX/2019. I place a call to XXXX only to find out the phone numbers were disconnected. This sent me in a panic mode. My husband and I filed a complaint with the Department of Transportation. I got a call from the DoT investigator informing me that this moving company is currently under an investigation and that there are over 124 victims in similar situation. \\nWith the help of the DoT I was able to located some of my stuff at a self storage facility only 2 miles away from XXXX. They took what they wanted for themselves and dumped the rest and did not make payments for the storage unit for months. The self storage facility tried every week to collect payments from the person who signed the contract with them Named XXXX ( it turns out that XXXX is also XXXX and many other alias names she was using ) but with no success for months. The day I located my things was the day the unit was in the process of being auctioned off. I had to hire a attorney to get an emergency hearing with the XXXX court to to a Temporary Restraining Order to prevent my belongings from being auctioned off. My legal fees added up to {$22000.00} just to secure our things. There was a lot of things stolen by the XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX. \\nAt this point, my husband I contacted our creditcard company to file an dispute. Citi gave me a conditional credit and asked for document to supper the dispute. I emailed them all the supporting document. Month and a half later the dispute was denied and with a letter indicating \"\" disputing quality of the services received and for the missing or damaged of personal items, we can not place a dollar value as amount of compensation. \\'\\' This company scammed us and 124 other customers. They are being investigated for fraud and for a crime. The fact Citi is honoring XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and not the loyal customer is absolutely disgusting in my opinion. \\nI\\'ve requested multiple request and filed an appeal but I have been told the decision is final.\"\\nOn XX/XX/2020 I charged several food items bought at Walmart on my Capital One credit card. The total was {$24.00}. Two packages of beef liver at {$2.00} each subtotaled {$4.00}. Unfortunately, the meat was rancid. The merchant ; s refund policy was, because of the XXXX Virus, not to return items to the store but to file a claim with the credit card company. I have tried to do so repeatedly without being able to do so. First, Capital One does not allow disputes to be made at one \\'s account online. Instructions are to call customer service refunds at XXXX. For several weeks I have attempted to do so, but each time a recording at Capital One says that the wait will be more than an hour. It makes no provision for it to call me back, as most companies do when there are long wait-times. Obviously, Capital One is intentionally preventing the public from disputing purchases in any way whatsoever..\\n\"I forgot to make my min payment on time this month. I think I paid it late at night after the cut off time. Cut off times are ridiculous in this day and age and I don\\'t know why or how these banks are even getting away with it. i wanted to speak with this bank in regard to this late fee and there is no way to contact them online directly in regard to a question specifically on your credit card. Most have a quick contact us button for this. They do not. You are forced to call in and the phone/automatic system is set up to make your life difficult, forcing you to enter all your personal info and then still asking for an account number!! Then, of course, the hold times are terrible as well during this time. \\n\\nI am literally carrying a balance for years that I can not pay down. For the entire first half of 2019 we had experienced a severe hardship when my husband got laid off for over two months. I was awaiting SS XXXX for going on two years at the time. We were terribly backed up on all our bills including our mortgage. I did everything I can to meet our minimum monthly payments and not mar our credit and we barely came through unscathed. This of course caused us to accumulate a lot of interest on all our cards. I did close this account due to the frustration of getting hit with a few late fees during this hard time that i was forced to pay of course. Since then I have made a monthly payment on time, for a long time until this month. \\n\\nI think the interest is unreasonable and I would like to request that at least one year interest be waived as well as the current late fee, if I could get through to them! Times are hard right now. People are struggling. I made my payment. I\\'m sure there are many who aren\\'t even able to do that. I don\\'t think it\\'s fair that I have to pay a late fee and I would like to request a credit on some of the interest. maybe I can finally clear up this account.\"\\nI was at an appointment in a clinic between XXXX and XXXX, on XX/XX/2020, when I received a fraud alert for the credit card I had just used for travel. There were three alerts, two saying an attempted cash withdrawal of {$400.00} was declined, and the third saying an attempt to withdraw {$800.00} cash was approved. Another text asked me to respond yes or no to me having attempted the three transactions. I responded no, and I immediately received a text saying my credit card was restricted, and a number to report to the banks fraud department of what happened. They immediately credited my account and sent me a new credit card. Three weeks later, on Friday XX/XX/2020, they said the dispute was reversed because my credit card chip was read and my PIN number was used for the transaction. I told the representative my credit card was in my pocket at the time the transactions were made, and the last time I had used the card was a few days earlier in XXXX California, on Thursday XX/XX/2020. I also informed the bank that I was only using the card for international travel, as of late. The representative told me the charge would be reversed and I would not have to pay it, but it remains on my statement along with a new interest charge for the transaction.\\n\"On XX/XX/2020, I requested a balance transfer using my PenFed Power Cash Rewards credit card. The payment of {$510.00} went from Penfed to XXXX XXXX XXXX. After I entered my XXXX account number, I was given the option to select the ONLY name that came up after I entered my account number and that was XXXX XXXX XXXX. I selected the name and pressed confirm. I received a message saying the request was submitted successfully. On that day, I performed several balance transfers. I was informed that the balance transfer would take up to 10 days. Every account received their payment within 3-5 days except XXXX. I began to call XXXX credit card, which is under XXXX XXXX, to find out the status of the payment I submitted on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX/XXXX  XXXX said they never received any payment. I contacted Penfed to inform them that XXXX/XXXX  XXXX  has not received the balance transfer payment. On XX/XX/2020 I had a conference call with a rep from Penfed by the name of XXXX and a supervisor from XXXX/XXXX  XXXX by the name of XXXX ( employee number XXXX ). XXXX explained to XXXX that they needed something stating that my balance transfer to XXXX was rejected so penfed could resend funds. XXXX said there was no payment showing in any of their systems to give Penfed a notice of payment rejection. XXXX from XXXX/XXXX  XXXX explained that when things like that occur XXXX  XXXX has the ability to have that payment sent back to the cardholder \\' credit card. \\n\\nAfter the conference call I was under the impression that Penfed would cancel the payment and it would be returned to my credit card. No such thing occurred. I\\'ve spoken to multiple people, XXXX, XXXX Asst manager, XXXX XXXX, at Penfed with regards to my missing balance transfer payment. On XX/XX/2020, I spoke to a supervisor by the name of XXXX. He told me that somehow my payment went to XXXX instead of XXXX/XXXX  XXXX. XXXX is XXXX and XXXX XXXX parent company. Penfed has sent several messages to XXXX asking them to resend my payment. They claim they don\\'t have the payment. He said pended \\'s system is possibly not detecting that something went wrong with the balance transfer payment and they have to wait until it\\'s sent back to my credit card.', \"We made a purchase of {$11000.00} as part of a credit card promotion : Pay no interest if paid in full within 6 or 12 months. Interest will be charged to your account from the purchase date if the purchase balance is not paid in full within the 6 or 12 months or if you make a late payment. **No Interest if paid in full within 6 or 12 months. Interest will be charged to your account ( at the standard, variable APR of 29.49 % based on the Prime Rate ) from the purchase date if the purchase balance is not paid in full within the promotional period or if you make a late payment. Minimum monthly payments are required for this plan during the promotional period. Required minimum purchase of {$500.00} for the 6 month plan or {$1500.00} for the 12 month plan. XXXX XXXX Credit Card Accounts are offered by Comenity Capital Bank, which determines qualifications for credit and promotion eligibility. At no time will the minimum payment due be less than {$27.00}. Minimum Interest Charge is {$2.00}. Standard variable APR of 29.49 % based on the Prime Rate. \\nPayments of {$650.00} were made by automated payment setup through our bank on or around the XXXX of every month to waive interest costs if paid in full by the term 's due date. Monthly due dates were on the XXXX of each month. However, the last month 's payment date was on the XXXX of XX/XX/2019. The payment was made in that month on the usual date of the XXXX, which was still only six days late. We realized our mistake after thinking everything would be automatically taken care of and called the XXXX XXXX credit card customer service which is Comenity Bank. We were passed around from person to person while they claimed that our issue was being escalated. Every response was the same and no negotiation took place at all. We feel that the early due date on the last month is to intentionally trap people who use automated bill payments or those who budget bill payments at the end of the month. We think that due to the fact no one would try and negotiate with us, and being so obtuse, when all our payments were made in good faith, indicates they intentionally try to trick people into paying the 29.49 % interest.\", 'We recently completed two balance transfers with First National Bank of Omaha. The current balance is about {$11000.00}. \\n\\nFirst of all, I have no idea how FNBO is calculating the minimum monthly payment. If you review the statement due on XX/XX/2020, it states the minimum monthly due is {$400.00}. In the minimum payment warning box, it states if only the minimum payment due is made for the next 9 years, an estimated total of {$13000.00} will be paid. The interest rate is fixed and 5.99 %. For 9 years, there are 108 months. If {$400.00} is paid over 108 months, the amount paid would be {$43000.00} instead of {$13000.00}. \\n\\nThe prior month, it stated {$480.00} was the minimum due. The statement said if paid off over 10 years at the minimum monthly payment, an estimated total of {$14000.00} would be paid. For 10 years, there are 120 months. If {$480.00} is paid over the 120 month period, the amount paid would be {$58000.00} instead of {$14000.00}. \\n\\nThen, in the same boxes, it shows how many years it would take to pay off the balance if a higher amount is paid. For example, if you review the statement due on XX/XX/2020, it suggests paying {$350.00}. This isn\\'t even the minimum monthly due reflected on the statement. It states the time to pay off the balance would be 3 years and the estimated amount paid would be {$12000.00} with a {$670.00} savings. If you review the statement due on XX/XX/2020, it suggests paying {$370.00}. This is not the minimum monthly due reflected on the statement. It states the time to pay off the balance would be 3 years and the estimated amount paid would be {$13000.00} with a {$700.00} savings. \\n\\nAnd, I was shocked to see how much my minimum monthly payment is after the balance transfer. The credit card statement doesn\\'t state what percentage the payment is based on and the credit card agreement is vague at best. Under Payments, section B, it states the amount of my minimum monthly payment is indicated on my billing statement and calculated as shown on the schedule. Based on the payments on my last three statements, the percentage is as high as 4 % and as low ar 3.5 %. So, there is not a stable percentage that the minimum amount due is based on. \\n\\nI am attaching my last 3 billing statements and the cardholder agreement. There is something wrong with the way they are calculating the payment as well as the amounts under \"\" minimum payment warning \\'\\'.\"\\nGood Afternoon, I went to make a purchase with one of my credit cards that was issued by Synchrony bank and it was denied. I called the number on the back of my card and a customer service rep stated that my account was CLOSED. I asked why and they stated that I will receive a letter with 5-7 business days. So got me thinking about my other cards that I have through them and started calling and All of them stated that my account was CLOSED. I have been a customer of theirs for 4 plus years with no issues. I did carry several credit cards with them, most with XXXX balance, always paid on time, never went over or even close to my credit limit, always paid way more then minimum due. My credit was not great when first started with them due to job loss but I was determined to improve my credit rating. Most of the cards started out with little available credit and as I got established with them, they kept increasing my credit limits as well as giving me more credit cards. I have been an exceptional customer since I started using them and now within a day all my hard work gone!! At one point one of the reps told me to contact Transunion because that was the nail in the coffin due to my credit rating going down. Yes, I have been using more credit due to the pandemic but again nothing crazy and it was not even close to what I had available to me and again always pay my bills. I just think is fair that they can treat people this way. They could of decreased my credit limits first as a warning but instead they kept increasing credit limit the BAM accounts closed.\\n\"In the month of XX/XX/XXXX, I went shopping to XXXX to buy my mother a gift of {$83.00} for her birthday. The lady who rang me up at the end of the purchase asked if I wanted to apply for a XXXX card and she pressured me to apply. She said if I applied today I would get 15 % off of my purchase and it would help her out with her boss if I did. So I thought it would help her out not knowing it would damage me instead. \\n\\nIn XXXX of XXXX, it says I have an inquiry at Target because I was trying to take out a credit card as well. I never applied for a credit card there.', 'There is a credit card from synchrony bank that was opened over a year ago. I have notified the company that I did not opened this credit card and that I never knew about this credit card until I started getting bill about past due balances. \\n\\nI live a single life and unfortunately I have had many girls I meet stay over at my house. I have had many different girlfriends stay at my previous home and one of them could have opened credit cards in my name without me being aware. I pay all my bills on time and take my credit seriously. However, in this situation, I did not incur this debt and need your help in helping me resolve this with the bank.', 'I made a large payment ( thousands of dollars ) to my Capital One credit card by accident. I was using an online bill pay tool from my bank and clicked on the wrong payee. I noticed right away that I had made this payment in error, and I called Capital One that same day. Capital One told me to hang up and call my bank. I did so, but the payment had already been processed by the bank, and the bank told me that I\\'d have to request a credit balance refund from Capital One. I called Capital One back and they told me that they could issue a refund as soon as the payment cleared. \\n\\nThat was several weeks ago. Since then, I have been on several hours-long telephone calls with Capital One trying to get my credit balance refunded. Each time, the person I speak with tells me that I haven\\'t submitted enough information. I have given them everything they\\'ve asked for. I have provided them with a bank statement showing that the erroneous payment came from my account, that I own the account, etc. But each time, they tell me it\\'s not enough and they need more information. Now they are telling me that they need to speak with my bank, but they can\\'t hold for more than ten minutes and my bank has a hold time longer than ten minutes. I don\\'t know what to do at this point. I also submitted a written request for a refund of my credit balance. It is a lot of money and I suspect that Capital One is intentionally withholding it from me for some reason.\"\\nI recently opened a card with Capital One, the Savor One. It arrived this past weekend, XX/XX/19, at which point I activated it and began to use it. All was fine. Today, XX/XX/19, I went to use the card and it was declined. I called the company to figure out what was going on. I had last used the card on XX/XX/XXXX and it was fine. I had not been notified of an issue either. The customer service agent told me there was a restriction on my card and I would need to provide photographic evidence of 3 forms of ID : driver \\'s license, social security card, and a utility bill, the latter of which they would need to call and verify my account. They needed this to verify my identity and lift the restriction on my account. I immediately took issue with this because none of this was requested upfront when I signed up for the card. I wouldn\\'t have moved forward if I knew that kind of lengthy check would be required. The biggest issue is the social security card which I don\\'t have, and do not want to go through the rigamarole of getting a new card issued. I asked to go through another verification means ( security questions, social security number, mobile/email verification, authorize my purchases, etc. ) or provide 2 of 3 IDs requested and they refused. They refused, citing there was no way to move forward. They also would not tell me why the restriction was placed, which is absolutely absurd. The manager, who I asked to be transferred to by this point, said there was no one else who could help, and no way to access someone in the department that deals with the restrictions. She also noted because the card was restricted, I wouldn\\'t be able to pay the existing balance online or do a balance transfer to another card so I could get out of my relationship with Capital One. I was essentially stuck until I provided the IDs to get the restriction off. I\\'m filing this complaint as this is absolutely ridiculous, and I hope someone will look further into this issue so this does not happen to other customers. I understand verification needs, but I expect to be notified of an account restriction and I want to know why and what kind of account restriction I\\'m dealing with. Further, if I note the ways I can\\'t comply with said verification they should find an alternative or tell customers upfront what will be expected. Lastly, there is no reason I should not be allowed to make payments online or transfer the standing balance to another account if I just want to end the relationship.\\n\"A purchase was made at Macy \\'s for {$56.00} on XX/XX/2019.

The online payment did not go through. I made a payment of {$560.00} on XXXX XXXX and was told the late fee would be dropped. The account given to the customer service evidently was missing the final number. The representative did not realize there were only 9 digits instead of 10. The bank of course could not process it. A {$27.00} returned check fee was added then when I called explained the fee was removed on XX/XX/2019. I paid for the original purchase of {$56.00} and the late fee and returned check fee were removed from my account by Macy \\'s.

I stated I was in Colorado and absolutely not!!! I did not do those charges.

He stated I have nothing to worry about and they caught the fraud in time. I checked my account, and at that point all of my money was still inside my account.

The name was XXXX XXXX ... I DO NOT know this name, I know nothing of this person and I did not do this transfer!

And then she proceeded to tell me they have 10 business days to investigate the fraudulent charges and would be emailing me back with an answer of what they had come up with the results. On XX/XX/2020 I received two emails From American Express Serve stating they had done their investigation and they have determined no error occurred at that transaction question and was authorized. Therefore the transaction is not eligible for credit to my account. I have filed a police report # XXXX and # XXXX With The XXXX Police Department. I have also filed a report with the XXXX XXXX XXXX FDIC, and all three reporting credit bureaus for fraud.

In addition to calling Chase, I have also called, and spoke with, the branch manager where I opened my checking account. The story they told me is as follows : ( 1 ) initially Chase mistakenly credited the points to a different credit card of mine -- a credit card that was not set up to get points. ( 2 ) then, they credited the points to an old account of the right credit card ( I had to get a new card because of fraud ). For some reason, the points were not transferred to the new card. \\n\\nChase \\'s \"\" research department \\'\\' started the \"\" research inquiry \\'\\' process at least three times and each time erroneously closed it before talking to me and before resolving the issue.

After receiving the card I attempted to add it to apple pay which sent me over to the fraud department to verify my identity which I completely understood. However, once on the line with the fraud early warning department they asked me to verify a good cell number for them to text. Like a growing number of Americans I use a pre-paid plan for my cell service, which is also the number listed on the account and they could not use it because it\\'s a pre paid number. This is apparently the only option they have. You can verify, social, date of birth or account number. The only other way they can verify is by snail mail. I went ahead and waited for the letter since the agent stated this was the only time I had to do this. About a week later it arrived and I reactivated the card and added it to XXXX XXXX and it was fine. I\\'ve had no problems until now. A few weeks ago I added on an authorized user and I was having an issue receiving his card. My apartment uses PO boxes and for some reason since the PO box was registered to me, and the letter was address to my authorized user the post office kept on returning. After the second time happened I decided to call Citi and ask if they mail it to his address. I did that this morning. I spoke to a very nice lady in customer service who after doing some verification was able to do just that. Later today when logging into the app to make a payment I received an alert to call the fraud department. I called in to fraud and was asked to go through the same process again. Again my phone number would not work and agent told me they\\'d have to send me another letter via snail mail. This is getting ridiculous. At this point I was quite upset and asked to speak to a supervisor. After telling the supervisor about the issue they told me essentially they could not do anything until I receive that letter and there\\'s no other way to verify. I still had the original letter and asked if I could use that and they said no. I asked if there was anyway they could overnight the letter or expedite the letter since it\\'s happened before and the supervisor really didn\\'t respond except for saying there\\'s nothing they can do until I get the letter. This is just ridiculous Citi is making me go through an undue hardship just because I don\\'t have a contract cell phone. There has to be a better fix or solution to this.

XXXX \\'s website with my Capital One visa card. They are based in the XXXX XXXX. Capital One, the credit card company, did not authorize the purchase. I called them to speak to a fraud specialist, XXXX, employee ID number XXXX and she verified my identity through their app by sending me a push. She then told me to go ahead to make the purchase. The authorization was rejected again. She then said that she would need further identification to lift the restriction on my card. I said that I could provide a passport card, which is issued by the US Federal government, or a passport. She said that this was not a valid form of ID for their company. At that point, since this is not the first time I\\'ve had trouble making international online purchases using my Capital One visa card, I said I wanted to redeem the points I had accumulated in around 20 years of being a client and close the account. She said I could only unlock the account for those purposes by providing a driver \\'s license or a state ID. I do not drive and I have no use for a state ID since a passport card or passport will suffice. The next day, I called again and spoke to another supervisor in their fraud department, XXXX, employee ID number XXXX   XXXX. She said that unless I provided a driver \\'s license or a state ID, my account will be locked. She said I had no recourse since she was the highest in the chain of command that I could speak to on the phone. I demanded to speak to someone in their corporate office but she said she could not transfer me. I subsequently wrote an email to XXXX XXXX, President of Financial Services, in their corporate office. I have not heard back from him. \\n\\nAs an indication of how ludicrous their practices are, I subsequently made two purchases from the same vendor using my XXXX card and my XXXX XXXX debit card. I did not need to confirm my identification using a state ID or a driver \\'s license. \\n\\nCapital One is practicing discrimination against customers who do not drive and do not have a state ID. I wont get a state ID and incur additional expenses just to continue using this credit card. I have called numerous times to their fraud department to no avail. At this point, I just wish to redeem the points I have accumulated over 20 years and close the account. However, I am not able to redeem the points because my account is locked. The reason for locking my account is unclear to me as is the fact that Capital One does not accept a US federal government issued passport or passport card as a valid form of ID even though the U.S. federal government is a higher authority than any state government. There are all kinds of legal ramifications that follow from the discriminatory conduct of Capital One \\'s credit division and fraud department.\"\\nI\\'m filing a compliant due to the Federal Reg that a company is required to notify the consumer about a decrease credit limit on their acct. I paid my acct in full on XXXX XXXX and the account limit was XXXX ; however, I logged onto the account on XX/XX/2020 and discovered that my credit had been decreased to XXXX. I have called to get in touch with customer service but stayed on hold for 45 minutes and called dropped. Im currently dealing with ramification of the corona virus and this is real sad that Macy \\'s just dropped my limit without sending me notification within 30-45 days of the change as well as effecting my credit score to decrease dramatically.\\n\"I contacted XXXX XXXX at Citibank because I was making my payments of {$300.00} and Citibank got greedy and raised my minimum payment to {$570.00}. I explained my unfortunate set of circumstances and tried to take preventative actions with Citibank asking for Citi to work with me as unfortunately have fallen short and would to modify terms. \\n\\nTemporary hardship plans - These plans are typically set for 6 or 12 months. I am requesting CITIBANK to reduce my account to 2 % of my current balance. I am requesting for CITIBANK to address the interest rate and reduce to anywhere from zero to 9 %. I am requesting for CITIBANK to waive fees and penalties and offer me a pre-plan arrangement. I requested for any long term hardship program - provide me with payments amortized over 5 years ( 60 months ) which would be similar to the temporary plans of 2 to 2.5 % of the current balance set as your monthly payment.', 'We closed our Capital One account a few months ago after the general public learned they had been hacked. The company had no problem doing this. For the past couple of months we have been unable to access our account online but Capital One is still taking money from our checking account on a monthly basis since we did set up auto pay. The last payment was withdrawn on XX/XX/2020. We did not receive either a statement or a notice that the payment was made. We called Cap One today XX/XX/XXXX-20 beginning at XXXX and after being transferred 3 times and almost 2 hours later we were cut off and no resolution to our problem took place. \\nOur first call ( after a 10 minute wait ) was answered by XXXX who stated she could only do verifications and transferred us to another person ( after a 20 minute wait ) named XXXX or XXXX or something like that. She had a heavy accent. After several times trying to understand our problem she said she couldn\\'t help because the account is closed and we were transferred to another place. After a 1 hour hold we were cut off without speaking to anyone. \\nWe are frustrated and feel ripped off that we are not able to see our account but yet they are taking our money. \\nWe aren\\'t sure if Capital One is practicing fraud, deception or just plain bad business but we want online access and out of this card completely.\"\\nI pay my credit card off and USAA constantly puts my payment on hold for 7 days and it clears my Credit Union within 24 hours of being submitted\\n\"I contacted Suntrust Bank approximately mid-XXXX  XXXX  because I noted charges on my account that were not mine. I looked for my credit card and did not find it. \\n\\nA letter was emailed to me which is dated XX/XX/XXXX verifying that I had contacted them about the lost card and the charges which were not mine. There were six charges that were not mine. Only one charge which was a monthly recurring charge was mine for {$5.00} to XXXX XXXX XXXX. It was the only reason that I was checking the account to pay on it. \\n\\nI will send you the letter ; it states that they would contact me for further information - which they never did. They did send me letters via email about the 6 charges. There were 5 letters addressing the 6 charges as one company ( XXXX XXXX ) had two charges. The other stores were at XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX # XXXX, XXXX # XXXX, XXXX  # XXXX XXXX  and XXXX XXXX XXXX. Combined, the total was {$1100.00}. \\n\\nInstead of contacting me for any further information, they sent me a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX which was less than 30-days later from the initial claim stating that they had found that these were my charges and the charges were placed back onto my account and I was told that I was responsible for these charges. It is clear to me that they did not investigate anything but, rather, made an expedient and advantageous decision for their company and, basically, pinned this responsibility onto me. \\n\\nI called numerous times - especially after looking at what my options were on the internet - to discuss this matter with their fraud department. I believed that I had the option to appeal this decision at which they had erroneously arrived. However, they told me point blank that they would not accept my request for an appeal. \\n\\nI contacted CFPB via phone and discussed with a CFPB my options and how I should proceed. I told that person that I had requested my entire file on this claim and that the SunTrust Bank representative had assured me that I would be sent all the information as to how they had arrived at the decision via their \\'investigation \\' that they obviously had not performed. \\n\\nAt one point in the multiple conversations that I pursued with the SunTrust Bank, I was told that the claim was denied due to \\'inconsistencies. \\' I asked them to explain what this meant and they stated that I shop at these stores. This is not true. I have shopped, previously, at XXXXXXXX XXXX but as one can see by my statements over the several years that I have been with SunTrust Bank, that I seldom shop there. I think that I found one charge at a XXXX store and that was years ago. I am not even sure that it was the same XXXX XXXX store as the fraudulent charge. \\n\\nThere are many XXXX stores throughout this area, I believe, and the amount that I spent was certainly not the sizable amount that was on this particular disputed charge. I am a single person, XXXX years old and I simply do not eat nor cook that much. Mostly, my groceries are purchased from XXXX and XXXX. \\n\\nThe other stores listed in the dispute - XXXX # XXXX, XXXX  # XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX  XXXX, and XXXX XXXX - I do not shop at. \\n\\nSo, I waited a considerable amount of time for this file to be sent to me because I was told that it was important to include everything that I could for this claim on the initial filing. After waiting a couple of weeks, I contacted the SunTrust Bank again and I was very upset to find out that the file had never been sent. \\n\\nBasically, they did not investigate anything. The refused to allow me to appeal the case. Then, they lied to me over the phone and told me that they were sending me all the information that I had asked for. I persisted and again they assured me that they would send me the entire file. I told them that I was going to report them to a government organization. Again, the file on their investigation never materialized but rather they sent me a letter stating that they had reviewed the case again and they were standing with their decision. \\n\\nIt has taken me some time to contact the CFPB because I waited all this time for promised paperwork/documentation that would never arrive. Then, with the holidays and my own busy schedule, it has been hard to carve out the time to pursue this filing. I have already invested a dozen hours in this matter to no avail. \\n\\nI paid the amount in a timely manner because I can not have my credit score ruined on top of this entire mess. SunTrust Bank has behaved very badly, unethically and unscrupulously. Please contact me if there is further information or documentation that I can offer. I have had an account with SunTrust Bank since XXXX.\"\\nSee attatched XX/XX/2018 statement. Kindly Note the page with Adjustment Purchases.

No. I have been paying them in full for months now except for the {$97.00}. I spoke with a supervisor last month that assured me it would no longer show. It was a fraud charge to begin with. I owe them {$86.00} which I will pay in full. They can not show me anywhere that I charged another {$97.00} or any balance for that amount.

I reached out to XXXX XXXX, at XXXX  XXXX XXXX and he claimed that it was a mistaken charge and that he would issue a refund. I waited a couple weeks but never saw a refund, so I reached out to my bank, Chase, and asked them to begin a credit card chargeback. They credited my account for the total amount while they investigated. They reached out for more evidence on the dispute, I provided them with all of the contact from the merchant, including him admitting that it was a mistaken charge, that he had tried to issue a refund, and that there was no invoice or record of me asking for the charges to be made. \\n\\nSomehow, Chase ruled in the merchants favor and I was told that I would need to physically mail Chase to reopen the chargeback, or they could transfer it to their fraud department. I asked them if they thought that was the right way to move forward and they said sure, and transferred the dispute to the fraud department. Fast forward another month and the fraud department has also ruled in the merchant 's favor, even though he claims he has never fought the disputes and even told his CC processor, XXXX, that he did not want to argue the charges.

They further noted that any balances on my card for charges made up through XXXX XXXX would be moved to a 0 % interest rate until the balance is paid in full. \\n\\nHistorically, i have not incurred any interest charges or late fees on this card and so the refund of these fees would not apply in my case. In terms of the 0 % offer, since my payment due date is XX/XX/XXXX i had already paid my balance in full by the time i received this letter and so I also did not benefit from this 0 % offer.

I told macys that I can\\'t pay the bill until I return the items b/c I dont \\' know how much to pay. they told me ok. Then in middle of summer the credit people called me and I told them I would pay some of the balance if they stop harassing me and calling me 4 times a day as long as they give me time until my dr says ok to go to malls. finally dr said I can go and I went right away and returned XXXX dollars worth of merchandise. macys refuses to take off 2 late fees and all the interest. I told them probably 30 times with 30 diff representatives that they are harrasing me and I will pay everything I owe but will not pay any interest or late fees b/c it was not in my control. offered to get them a dr note. they would keep me on the  phone for an hour and at the end say there is nothing they can do. will not take off. finally today I called myself so I can try to fix this finally and spoke to a manager by the name of XXXX XXXX. He was extremely obnoxious and yelling at me to let him talk. I was shocked. he again said he will not take off the late fees.Macys is harassing me and trying to steal from me. it is not honest and I feel they are being XXXX. it doesn\\'t have to be a religion. they are taking advantage of me b/c of my XXXX XXXX XXXX. I want to call my lawyer but dont \\' have the money now due to my business being pushed down b/c of covid.

Then, XXXX XXXX ( Rep # : XXXX ) changed his position stating that decision was made due to balance on American Express Account increased, yet 40 % available credit remains. I stated I took advantage of promotional rate at 0 % which American Express offered, reason for not paying down any significant amount towards balance, also always maintained good standing with account. American Express failed to access over all credit of card member, but decided to just looking at American Express account, not a proper way to assess someone\\'s credit worthiness. \\n- The CFPB and other financial regulators have encouraged financial institutions to help and work with their customers to meet their needs around COVID19 urgent situation, but American Express \\'s business practice doesn\\'t reflect the effort, instead of helping, working with card members, American Express chose to create more hardship, knowing it may bring financial uncertainty for many people/card member who could experience a loss of income due to illness or workplace closures. \\n- Also spoke to XXXX XXXX ( Supervisor ) ( Rep # : XXXX ), but couldn\\'t provide valid reason, couldn\\'t help. \\n- Both XXXX XXXX/XXXX  XXXX lack in knowledge, lack customer handling skills, also failed to deliver fact, proper training is urgently needed. \\n- Many of large financial institutions are diligently helping/working with their customers, going through tough time, but American Express chose not to, but rather to create a hardship for their customers with given COVID19 urgent situation.', 'HSBC contacted me, in late XX/XX/XXXX, via text and email, regarding their concern over a fraudulent charge, from a XXXX XXXX XXXX company based out of XXXX XXXX, Nevada, on my credit.

And I was told by Chase this card would as well. It even stated that in their online advertising at the time I applied This is a matter of principle even more than this fee If Chase told me the 1st year fee would NOT be waved, I would never have requested this card Chase obviously shows little concern for their customers.

We can not access our money. We can not check our balances. We can not call customer service. We are left completely in the dark for the past 12 hours. We have no idea what is happening with our money. There is absolutely no communication from Bluebird by American Express about the issue. They only provided canned responses and claim that we can continue to use our cards as normal ( which we can not ). The cards are getting declined at ATMs and POS \\'s.\\n\"I\\'ve had a credit card for years with Bank of America. In XX/XX/XXXX I paid off my balance and because I had it on auto pay, it continued to pay and I ended up with a credit balance. They notified me repeatedly since they didn\\'t want the credit balance so I turned off the auto payment and they sent me a check. \\n\\nThen in XX/XX/XXXX I did another balance transfer. I forgot I had turned off the auto payment so I received a late fee on XX/XX/XXXX. I get it, it was my mistake so paying the fee was fine.

I talked to somebody to ask why I was being charged this fee. They said because I had the late fee in XXXX, it will continue to charge this every month. My understanding is they aren\\'t supposed to charge interest on fees so I\\'m confused how they are justifying this to begin with. They said they would refund the fees ( they just refunded one as far as I can tell ). When I asked what I could do in order to get this fixed so I wasn\\'t charged this fee monthly, they told me they couldn\\'t do anything to fix it but I could call every month and request a refund. Seriously?? I was very upset at this point due to their unreasonable response and believe I even talked to a supervisor. Asking customers to take the time to call each month to request a statement fix for {$1.00} is craziness. It\\'s their error. I realize it\\'s only {$1.00} but it\\'s wrong and they could be doing this with a million customers each month. \\n\\nThey have continued to charge this fee every month as they can see on my statements. I obviously just need to pay it off but want to bring awareness to this predatory fee practice. This definitely violates UDAAP and am surprised this is happening at such a large financial institution. \\n\\nI look forward to hearing the resolution on this matter and hope there can be further investigation as to how many customers are being charged fees inappropriately.\"\\nThis account is being reported.

A 5 percent fee of XXXX was then charged because the loan was otherwise interest free thru XXXX, XXXX. Another promotional offer is on my account where all interest is deferred and interest will be waived if the balance gets paid by XX/XX/XXXX. My account payments and credits were applied to the balance due XX/XX/XXXX instead of the loan due XX/XX/XXXX. This makes the XXXX 5 percent check fee much too expensive as well as misleading. XXXX, who gave no last name initial, said on XX/XX/XXXX about XXXX XXXX  that my payments could not be re-alloacated to the balance due XX/XX/XXXX. I just authorized another so-called minimum monthly payment which no doubt will reduce the balance due XX/XX/XXXX instead of the loan due XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX said there is no Supervisor to review my complaint because XXXX is an \"\" Escalation Specialist # 5. \\'\\' He said I should have known better than to accept the Balance Transfer Convenience Check that they sent in the mail. The terms say payments are applied to the lowest interest rate first. Since the XX/XX/XXXX loan interest is deferred and subject to full waiver, it makes no difference to them that I am currently paying zero interest on that loan.', 'I would like to file a complaint against US BANK for their customer service and credit reporting departments unprofessionalism towards me and their poor handling of my dispute. I contacted the customer service department numerous times last year after my banking and credit card accounts were mysteriously frozen because I was not made aware that a statement was missing and left undisclosed to me. The shocking way in which I found out my credit cards minimum payment was apparently a few days late was by the bank shutting down ALL access to my checking accounts and credit card, which is insane to me because this could have absolutely ruined my life had I been desperately in need of my money. Thankfully I was at the ATM for some petty cash for the day but I was sincerely shocked at how they handled an apparent late credit card statements that was due only a few days before that. No one called me, emailed me or mailed me a statement or a notice of any payment being due or even late. though not passed the grace period. My main reason for this complain is that within days of the missing statement/email reminder phone call I got a notification from my credit monitoring service that I had lost nearly 100 points off of my FICO score because US Bank prematurely sent my monthly status as 30 days late for XXXX of 2018. I had a nearly perfect FICO score before that and have so all of my life. It was XXXX before they affected it.\\n\\nAs soon as I was aware that there was a statement due I called the customer service department and spoke to a representative, made the payment and asked that I be made certain that this would not affect my credit and right on that phone call the representative promised me and assured me that I was still within the grace period and I would not have anything negative reported against name and if by some chance it was I would be able to call in and have them reverse the negative reporting considering I never received any sort of notice for payment due reminder and that this has never happened to me not to mention my excellent customer status with the bank and my mortgage. \\nI was furious when I saw my credit report and I went into the branch and spoke to a supervisor who said she couldnt reverse it on her end but if I contacted the customer service rep on the back of my card again they would do it for me. \\nI called the department right away and then I was told that I had to submit this dispute in writing. Why? Is that the law, to submit it only in writing? Who is that convenient for? Why must I submit my personal information and situation thru the mail? One letter has completely gone missing and no retuned receipt was sent back to me nor was the letter forwarded back. Who is now at privilege of my birthday, last four of my social security number, complete credit card number and address? Also, this stall method means I look like an unreliable credit customer to all of my other creditors during the extent of their investigation. How is that fair? Why couldnt they take my dispute right then and there? Why inconvenience us and risk the letter getting lost and my credit damaged for even longer and further credit denied to me because of this late payment? Imagine my frustration here. One person leads me to another and no one wants to handle anything that concerns my unique situation. \\nFurther, I submitted 4 letters, 3 via certified mail with return receipt requested and one via regular mail to ensure that the letters were received by all departments found on the US Bank website ad via XXXX. By the 4th week I only revived back 2 of the certified returned receipts but not from a 3rd department. I dont understand why they did not receive my 3rd letter and I  would like that investigated because I spent a lot of money on these letters and it seems to have gone missing. \\nIn my letter I specifically stated my issues and my frustrations that no one called me or emailed me or mailed me anything regarding a payment due and I also reminded them of their very own words when they assured me that my credit would not be affected and yet it was. \\nI sent this out on XX/XX/ 2018 and in response I received a very generic and unacceptable response from ONLY 1 department in XXXX XXXX, MO. Where were the responses or letter acknowledgment from the other 3 departments? I was disappointed to see that the 1 and only response was generic with no facts or details referenced. Clearly no one read my letter apart from the sentence about the 30 day late XXXX. No one took my situation into consideration and their illegal acts of saying one thing to me and promising me that my financial life would not be jeopardized and them doing the complete opposite is a contradiction. There is not even a single mention of my complaint regarding their poor handling of my credit card account and their dangerous stunt of freezing all of my money and credit pending a payment! \\nHow are they allowed to hold my financial life hostage until they get a payment? What if I had a life and death situation? What If I had a huge financial decision to make that day? Their action wouldve completely jeopardized me. Why would this company not call me and notify me before doing something like this? \\nI have been a loyal customer with them for over 13 years and never expected this kind of treatment. There is some sort of discrimination here for sure because they are illegally ruining peoples lives in order to bank on fees and such. I never received a statement and that is their initial mistake. I sent a huge amount of documentation and it was all ignored and all they want to leave me with is that I can resubmit more information. \\n\\nI truly feel that I have been wronged and I would like the CFPB to investigate everything that has conspired here and to hold them accountable for being inconsistent and for such poor customer treatment. My letters were not answered, a response from 1 out of 4 addresses is unacceptable. I was told it was not affecting my credit but it did. My situation was not addressed and a generic shut down of my request to remove the unfair 30 day late on my credit was thrown at me. I have been a loyal customer and being 30 days late is obviously not consistent with me and they have completely disrespected me and over looked that, even for courtesy sake. I do not wish to escalate this to litigation but I have suffered tremendous financial backlash because of the 100 point credit score drop and I have been denied improved interest rate elsewhere as a result. \\n\\n( for security reasons I have created an email specifically to monitor and document this complaint and to avoid oversharing online on a public forum )', \"To whom it may concern, On XX/XX/2019 I placed an order on Kohls.com for the amount of {$110.00} and incorrectly used my saved shipping address, which I have recently moved from.

When I logged into my Kohls.com account, I saw that there was no way to cancel my order, so I contacted their customer service department.

In pursuant to 15 U.S.Code 1692a ( 4 ), The term creditor means any person who offers or extends credit creating a debt or to whom a debt is owed. I extended the credit which makes me the original creditor.\\n\\nIn accordance with 15 U.S.Code 1602 ( j ), The terms open end credit plan and open end consumer credit plan mean a plan under which the creditor reasonably contemplates repeated transactions, which prescribes the terms of such transactions, and which provides for a finance charge which may be computed from time to time on the outstanding unpaid balance. A credit plan or open end consumer credit plan which is an open end credit plan or open end consumer credit plan within the meaning of the preceding sentence is an open end credit plan or open end consumer credit plan even if credit information is verified from time to time. Pursuant to 15 U.S.Code 1602 ( l ), ( l ) The term credit card means any card, plate, coupon book or other credit device existing for the purpose of obtaining money, property, labor, or services on credit. \\n\\nIn pursuant to 15 U.S.Code 1666d, Whenever a credit balance in excess of {$1.00} is created in connection with a consumer credit transaction through ( 1 ) transmittal of funds to a creditor in excess of the total balance due on an account, ( 2 ) rebates of unearned finance charges or insurance premiums, or ( 3 ) amounts otherwise owed to or held for the benefit of an obligor, the creditor shall ( A ) credit the amount of the credit balance to the consumers account ; ( B ) refund any part of the amount of the remaining credit balance, upon request of the consumer ; and ( C ) make a good faith effort to refund to the consumer by cash, check, or money order any part of the amount of the credit balance remaining in the account for more than six months, except that no further action is required in any case in which the consumers current location is not known by the creditor and can not be traced through the consumers last known address or telephone number. \\n\\nIn pursuant TILA title 15 U.S.Code 1615, ( a ) Prompt refund of unearned interest required ( 1 ) In general, If a consumer prepays in full the financed amount under any consumer credit transaction, the creditor shall promptly refund any unearned portion of the interest charge to the consumer. In pursuant to 15 U.S.C 1692h, with my written direction I demand CAPITAL ONE to redirect ALL payments to me by check and removal of the fraudulent items from my consumer report.', 'Bank of America offered a promotion in Summer XX/XX/XXXX for a 0 % interest credit card until XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nI needed to buy an appliance that was on sale ( {$3500.00} ) and wanted to buy it with the 0 % interest card. I applied for the card in XX/XX/XXXX and was approved. But the card never came. Three weeks passed and still no card. Finally by XX/XX/XXXX, I was forced to buy the appliance on a different ( non-0 %  interest ) credit card because the sale was ending. When I called Bank of America they told me they would have to mail me another card. At this point though the card was useless because the whole point of getting the card was the 0 % interest promotion. I told the customer service rep to just cancel the whole thing and forget that a card had ever been issued. The customer service rep told me that instead I could transfer the {$3500.00} charge and Bank of America would waive the balance transfer fee. ( Effectively giving me a 0 % interest purchase. ) I agreed. \\n\\nImagine my surprised when the month end statement comes and I see that I was charged a {$150.00} balance transfer fee! \\n\\nI immediately called Bank of America and told them of the mistake. It took me two calls to resolve the issue and finally two months later on XX/XX/XXXX, I saw the {$150.00} balance transfer fee returned. \\n\\nEverything went fine for a couple months. I made payments on time and had no more issues. But this would not be my last run in with Bank of America customer service. \\n\\nIn XX/XX/XXXX, I went on a trip out of the country. I paid my credit card bill but because of the time difference I messed up when the last payment period was and missed the payment. Payment window closed on XX/XX/XXXX. I immediately made a payment on XX/XX/XXXX and asked if the late fee ( {$39.00} ) could be reversed. \\n\\nThe customer service rep told me it could not. \\n\\nI called two more times ( XX/XX/XXXX ; XX/XX/XXXX ). Finally, I was told that the reason I could not be refunded the {$39.00} was because I had already been refunded {$150.00} from the balance transfer incident. I explained that the balance transfer payment was made in reliance on a claim by Bank of America \\'s customer service rep and that I was paying for a mistake that Bank of America made! I asked to be redirected to customer retention and to compliance. Neither of those departments made any effort to examine my situation. They only told me that the {$150.00} fee that I was already \"\" credited \\'\\' was blocking any \"\" award \\'\\' they could give me. I told them this was completely ludicrous since the {$150.00} was charged based on Bank of America \\'s own mistake! \\n\\nI want my {$39.00} back.

Because of this, I made {$430.00} in payments to pay off the {$430.00} in purchases I made, not knowing they would not be applied to my purchases.

I attempted for over two months to contact the seller via email and telephone and never got a response.

After few more months went buy they never removed the charge and I contacted them for assistance. They stated that the matter was still under dispute and no interest was accruing. I continued to pay on the account as I have other charges from other sellers. At that point I contacted pay pal and they stated that it was still under dispute. In XX/XX/XXXX I started to accrue finance charges for this item. Paypal just closed the dispute and I continued to pay for a defective item so it would not affect my credit. So at this point it is almost paid off and I have accrued over {$210.00} in fees and interest for a noisy, defective transmission that makes my vehicle unreliable.

XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and the other on XX/XX/XXXX. I called XXXX Fraud department as soon as I realized my card was lost. They took my information and supposedly started my claim for the disputed charges. On that day I received an email from XXXX saying that they will be working on my claim and that they will be providing provisional credit of the XXXX fraudulent transactions within 10 days while they continue their investigation. Meanwhile, Provisional credit was never provided, nor there was any follow up nor documents sent to me. So, On XX/XX/XXXX, since I didn\\'t receive any communication from XXXX nor the fraudulent charges taken off my card, I called back XXXX fraud department to find out what was going on. I was told by an agent named XXXX, that there were NO notes on my claim, NO follow up and NO provisional credit on my account, he said he had to escalate it to a supervisor, that it seemed that my claim wasn\\'t looked at by any one. So he told me that I was going to receive a call from a supervisor. I received a call from a lady name XXXX from a phone number XXXX. I called back and told her that is NOT OK to be ignored, to report a claim to XXXX and to have this type of inaction and lack of help in resolving my claim. Meanwhile its almost a month. No follow up, the fraudulent charges are still on my account, no provisional credit was issued, my claim was ignored and XXXX inaction and lack of willingness to resolve my claim has caused me stress and in top of it, I have to be calling back and forth, almost every week trying to get their help in taking care of this issue. It is obvious that US Bank is trying to ignore my claim and to put the burden on me to collect interest and charges with fees on the fraudulent transactions. I do believe I\\'ve been ignored and treated with this horrible disparate treatment due to my XXXX Ethnicity.\\n\"My wife and I have had a B or A Visa Card (Account # XXXX and we have paid on time for 19 straight years with no late payments and near 800 credit scores.  .

Returning home from vacation we received this notice of late payment.  We immediately paid $2,000.  B of A could not find the account # but my wife clearly gave the correct # but Visa/B of A inadvertently took down the wrong number.  I protested this late payment and finally got a hold of upper management in customer service who said that they would delete this from the 3 Bureaus.  I trusted the lady who told this to me.  Then a couple of weeks later, I received a form letter stating that they did not remove this late payment and I called and said it went to their resolution department which said \"\"no\"\" they did not remove this.  If necessary, I will seek legal action against B of A Visa but I decided to contact you first.  Since this time, B of A has closed the account.\\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX; XXXX', 'On XX/XX/2020 I provided a letter to TD Bank , N.A .

Prior to calling you guys I proactively called XXXX to ask if they had released the funds, which the rep by the name of XXXX XXXX did confirm it was in fact released back to Cap1 on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX. When I spoke to XXXX, she advised there was no credit submitted back so she would need to call XXXX to confirm. She attempted to call them with no luck, but did say the other option was to file a dispute since it had been over 10 days from transaction date or try to call back and get a representative on the phone. \\n\\nI expressed to her I was on board to whatever was the easiest and fastest way to get the funds back since I was planning on using that money. Employee XXXX said regardless, a credit for that amount would be issued to my account within 3 days while dispute was open. If after the timeframe of the dispute they didnt hear back, then I would be charged that amount back and then would need to follow a different process. I agreed to all terms. \\n\\nOnce that was done, I mentioned to her that I had recently changed my number and wanted to see if it was an option for me to change my number with her. XXXX said she will need to send a verification text to my number, then I reminded her the number on file is no longer active, hence the reason for me wanting to update my number on file from XXXX to XXXX. XXXX then took my new number and said she will send a verification text. After a minute or so, she came back and said for some reason the system is not allowing her to send that text verification to my new number and said now I would need to send a copy for my Driver License to her. I immediately expressed to her I didnt feel comfortable sending over any of my government issued IDs and asked to forget about updating my phone number. \\n\\nI didnt think anything about it till I tried to make a purchase this morning XX/XX/XXXX. When I went into my APP, it read my account was RESTRICTED. Not knowing if it was related due to the dispute submitted over to XXXX, I called in to ask what was happening. I spoke to an inbound call center rep, whose name I forgot to ask, and she then advised the reason why my account was restricted was because of my verification. The rep said I would need to submit a copy of my DL. I then said I didnt make any changes and dont feel comfortable sending over my DL. Requested to speak with a manager. After 15 minutes holding for a manager, I was finally transferred to XXXX, employee ID : XXXX Freud and dispute supervisor. \\n\\nI went on to explain to her the situation and asked what I needed to do to get my account active. XXXX advised since my new phone number is not registering as a government verifiable number attached to me or for her to be able to call me to verify, the only option would be for me to send a picture of my DL to her using a link thatll go to her directly. XXXX reassured me after DL was verified it will be discarded. I again expressed to her I was not comfortable doing that but if it was the only option to reactive my account I would go ahead and send it over to her. \\n\\nTo my surprise XXXX texted my NEW none verified number, XXXX, the link where it requests me to capture my DL and send it back to her. \\n\\nI did what was requested and then confirmed she received it! I then asked why she could send me a text message to my NEW NUMBER requesting my TX state issued DL but could not send me a text verification code or why that couldnt be used as a form to verify it was me. This was Shocking to her and had no way to explain why that was the case. XXXX was extremely apologetic and said she has no idea what the systems work differently. After a few minutes, she asked if I recently got a new DL. I conformed and advised her I just renewed my DL a couple of weeks ago. She said because of that, she would not be able to remove the restriction!!! \\n\\nAt this point Im jumping through all your hoops to get my account active, even after I mentioned a few times I was not comfortable submitted my DL, for then XXXX to come back and say its not possible to remove the restriction. You can only imagine how upset I was at this time. I asked XXXX what other options I had. I offered to send her all documents I had available, which was a picture of my SS Card, DL and even a copy of my new contract with XXXX reflecting my new number and name. She said none are acceptable and will need to wait. \\n\\nThis is the worst experience Ive had with you guys in which I took over 2 hours of my time to get NOTHING resolved, but instead be told that IT CAN TAKE MONTHS for the government to update their systems and have my new number as a government verifiable number.

What an inconvenience for me as I hate calling in to call centers and mail mail? Who in this day and age mails in payments? I to all my transactions online!!!! \\n\\nI also offered the idea of me driving to the nearest Cap1 bank and verify with all parties on phone.

Please help.\\n\"I have both Synchrony and Care Credit accounts and my issue is with the unreasonable length of time Care Credit takes to apply larger payments and the lack of proper notice given to customers about this delay. \\n\\nAs of XX/XX/2020, I was carrying a balance of {$2300.00} on my Care Credit account with a promotion expiration date of XX/XX/2020. Anticipating that I would need to utilize all of my available credit ( {$5000.00} ) for my dog \\'s XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, I paid this promotion balance of {$2300.00} online by ACH on XX/XX/XXXX. ( I made this payment from the same bank account that was already registered with Care Credit and from which my previous monthly payments had been processed by ACH. ) In doing so, I noted the following on the payment screen of Care Credit : \"\" Please allow 48 hours for this payment to be reflected on your account. \\'\\' Prior to picking my dog up from the hospital on XX/XX/XXXX, I checked the Care Credit website only to see that my available credit had not been updated. I called customer service and spoke to XXXX who told me that it takes 7 - 10 days for a payment over {$500.00} to be credited. I pointed out that there was no notice given of this policy on the payment screen and that my bank had cleared the funds on XX/XX/XXXX. She first said that this policy is posted on their website but then told me it was included in the Terms and Conditions. She told me there was nothing that could be done. I had the same conversation with a supervisor, XXXX, ( who said the payment threshold was {$1000.00}. ) I was told that it would not be possible for me to access my remaining available credit until the payment processed 8 days later. XXXX told me I could request an increase in my credit limit. I stated that I did not want to do this because of the adverse effect it would have on my credit score. Having no other option to pay for my dog \\'s XXXX and be able to bring him home from the hospital, I requested, and was approved for an additional {$5000.00}. As I told XXXX, if my credit was already going to have to take a hit, I would extend the limit. \\n\\nI have two complaints against Care Credit in this situation : 1 ) Taking 7 - 10 days to credit a larger payment is far in excess of normal and acceptable ACH banking time frames. This results in tying up customers \\' money for an unnecessary and unreasonable amount of time. Inducing customers to apply for additional credit to cover expenses as a result is anti-consumer. \\n\\n2 ) This delay in crediting payments should be noted clearly on the Care Credit website. Failure to include this policy on the payment screen along with the statement that payments may take 48 hours to be reflected is misleading and deceptive. \\n\\nI later looked on the Care Credit / Synchrony website for any mention of the 7 - 10 day hold and could find none.

The merchant then decided to take the rare step and pay to go to Arbitration. MasterCard shockingly ruled in the merchant \\'s favor. \\n\\nThe letter that I received from Citibank on XX/XX/XXXX via the online e-communitcation item stated the following : The billing dispute review process has been completed for the above listed item. The merchant has refused to issue credit to your account for the disputed charge. The merchant stands by their terms and conditions that were agreed upon at purchase. They do not allow returns on custom orders. They stated the wheels on the bicycle were custom. We are rebilling the disputed amount to your account. We are unable to assist you further with this matter. You will need to seek other means. We can not mandate the merchant issue credit. This investigation is now closed. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. \\n\\nThe merchant committed fraud in their claim that the was a custom order. I submitted proof that their claim was fraudulent both on XX/XX/XXXX and on XX/XX/XXXX. Citibank is negligent because it appears that they did not submit the crucial proof to the Arbitrators that the merchant had submitted fraudulent claims about this order being custom. The spare wheels I had ordered to be use in the winter for winter riding were never delivered, thus resulting in a refund via a MasterCard receipt on XX/XX/XXXX due to non-delivery. \\n\\nPlus, they claimed that the bike I was given had custom wheels. I never ordered custom wheels nor did I receive any other wheels, except the wheels that came with the XXXX XXXX XXXX bike. The wheels on the bike were stock expensive XXXX  XXXX wheels. I submitted proof of this. I am puzzled as to how the arbitrators could rule in favor of the merchant unless Citibank neglected to point this out or submit my evidence to the MasterCard Arbitrators. This was key factual evidence. \\n\\nI have been a loyal Citibank customer for over 23 years and I am disgusted with how Citibanks Executive Response Unit will not look into and help to correct this situation. I was assigned to XXXX XXXX in their Executive Response Unit who was investigating my case. However on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a phone call from XXXX XXXX on behalf of XXXX XXXX and she did not know all the details of the case and refused to let me speak to XXXX XXXX or the person who leads the Executive Response Unit. She kept stating that it is irrelevant. \\n\\nCitibank Executive Response Unit refused to discuss the case further even though I submitted proof on two occasions that the merchant has committed fraud. I have mountains of proof, yet Citibank does not want to be bothered and will not try to correct this major error. \\n\\nI was told on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX by two Billing Dispute representatives ( XXXX, then XXXX ) via recorded phone calls that the Citibank Investigators told the merchant \\'s bank that they are NOT going to return the money. The bike was returned and the merchant is in receipt of the bike. There is no proof the customer was advised of the stores return policy and did not sign anything acknowledging said policy. Credit to go back to customer. Citibank also stated that the merchant had provided a lot of conflicting information. \\n\\nAnd another major issue with this purchase is that the merchant never gave me the complete items that were purchased. There was a rouge manager who stole/kept all the supplied accessories that come with the bike and did not tell me that this high-end bike comes with a bag full of accessories. I was able to get a letter from the manufacturer ( XXXX XXXX ) and another local bike shop ( XXXX  XXXX  ) to explain that the bike should have been supplied with a long list of accessories. \\n\\nAs for the actual transaction, this purchase for one ( bike ), but was split into two transactions : A deposit of {$2500.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and the balance of {$5300.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. Unfortunately this was one purchase, but it required two transactions. A very important detail is that the {$2500.00} amount was Resolved In My Favor. I do not understand how the deposit part of this dispute was resolved in my favor, but the balance was not. \\n\\nOver the past year, I was provided with incorrect information and Citibank \\'s Billing Dispute department made countless errors. I was told by many supervisors that my case was mishandled and I received many apologies for their mistakes. I even received a courtesy credit of {$100.00} by a Supervisor named XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX to apologized for the errors that the Citibank representative who wrote up the billing dispute and was told that the employee will need to be resent to training. \\n\\nI am extremely disappointed and disgusted how I have been treated by Citibank. From the beginning they told me that I must return the merchandise as part of the Billing Dispute process. I followed every instruction and provided a mountain of evidence that the merchant was lying and committing fraud. \\n\\nIn the end, I was told, \"\" Sorry we can no longer help you. \\'\\' Not only was I rebilled {$5300.00} which is due on XX/XX/XXXX, but I do not even have the merchandise. This is a grave mistake on Citibank \\'s part because I am not convinced that Citibank neglected to send MasterCard my evidence that this was not a custom order, that the wheels on the bike were the stock wheels that come with an XXXX XXXX and that the merchant had been submitting conflicting information. \\n\\nI am asking for help in resolving this matter since I have nowhere to turn to. Again, Citibank must not have submitted my evidence that this was not a custom order and the photos and proof that the bicycle I received had the stock wheels on it that came with the bike. \\n\\nDates and Details : XXXX Placed a deposit of {$2500.00} for a high-end bike ( {$7700.00} ), water bottle cages ( {$89.00} ) and a low priced ( {$580.00} ) spare set of wheels that I intended to use for winter riding on harsh XXXX streets. I did not want to ruin the expensive carbon XXXX  XXXX wheel that came with the bike. Those wheels which were included with the bike are valued at {$2400.00} if purchased separately. So there was no need for a Custom Upgrade as the merchant had wrote on the side column of a photocopy of my receipt. Never did my receipt state anything about a custom order. ( Prices mentioned above are shown before tax. ) XXXX After a once week delay due to a fork color matching issue, \\'\\' the bike arrived late and I was told by the merchant to pay the balance of {$5900.00} in full. \\'\\' The spare set of wheel had not arrived yet, but I was told that I MUST pay the entire balance. I received the bike that I ordered the which came with high-end expensive stock wheels. \\n\\nA few weeks later I discovered that the merchant failed to give me all the included accessories that was in the shipping box and are the customers property with purchase. This was never a complete purchase, meaning I did not get everything I paid for since the manager withheld/ stole the accessories. This should have invalidated their return policy immediately. \\n\\nThe Fair Credit Billing Act dictates that there be a process by which one can question transactions involving goods or services you never received or merchants did not deliver in the way they were supposed to. This is exactly that situation. A dishonest merchant who tried to cheat an unassuming consumer. \\n\\nXXXX After three weeks of excuses of why my spare set of winter wheels have not arrived, the merchant kindly REFUNDED the wheels to my MasterCard . The amount was {$630.00}. So again, I never received the spare set of wheels. \\n\\nAlso on this day, after receiving the Refund for the spare wheels, I was told never to come back to the bike shop. With that, they were not going to honor my lifetime service on a bike that I paid a lot of money for. \\n\\nXXXX After being very upset how I was treated by the merchant, I called Citibank Billing Disputes to see what can be done. I spoke with a representative named XXXX who informed me that the call would be recorded. She said, Do you like to never have to deal with this merchant again? I said yes. She then said, OK, we are going to open a billing dispute. Since this purchase required two transactions, one for the deposit and one for the balance, I have to open a separate dispute for each, so my questions will be redundant. Once I open this dispute, I will send you paperwork for you to fill out and send back. You will return the bike to the merchant tomorrow and Citibank will take care of this. You will never have to deal with this merchant again. When I mentioned that the receipt said no returns on bikes, XXXX said, It does not matter. And when I told her that if I return the bike, I will need another bike since I am in a cycling club, XXXX stated, You can go ahead and buy the same bike from another authorized dealer that you trust. I was very comforted after this phone call since XXXX of Citibank assured me that everything will be taken care of.', 'Re : Fraud/stolen identity To whom it may concern, I am addressing above since there are several companies to which I must address this issue to : My name is XXXX XXXX.

This was absolutely devastating to my credit rating. \\nI have been grooming my credit rating for the past 20 years so that it would be the best it could be because I wanted to apply for a mortgage. This devastating blow to my credit rating came 2 weeks before my pre-approval after having exceptional over XXXX credit rating for decades. \\nPNC gave me no warning for this limit decrease. Nor have they done a good job of explaining the reasons for this limit decrease. I have not been referred to any documentation from them as to why this happened nor how it could happen from their regulations. \\nI called PNC Credit Card customer service and was on hold, after being transferred to multiple departments, for a total of 2 hours. I spoke to Customer Service, multiple supervisors, and the Underwriting department. I was told to contact the credit bureaus for their reasons for the decrease. I called each credit bureau, explained the situation and asked each bureaus customer service departments why this would happen- if there was anything dubious on my report. Each one said that my credit was flawless and that I there was no cause for concern. I have an exceptional payment history spanning XXXX decades. I then had to call BACK PNC with this information, which they replied I was to respond, in writing to the Consumer Credit Bureau Investigations Department to which they would respond within 30 days. My letter was mailed on XXXX. \\nI believe that this credit limit decrease was based on erroneous information or human error in interpretation of this information. I do not believe a complete and correct assessment of my credit information was made. \\nLike I said, this has been absolutely devastating to my credit rating and to me personally. I have been saving for a home for almost 20 years and I cant believe that this would happen after I have been so careful - especially two weeks before I decided, after 20 YEARS, that this was the moment I would apply for pre-approval on a mortgage. This creates a biased and inaccurate view of my credit rating that does not take into consideration the decades of exceptional credit I have. This is impacting my qualifications and potential rate for a mortgage, which equates to me losing thousands of dollars over time due to their mistake. \\nPlease note too, that, I have been a customer of PNC since XXXX.

I called to ask if they could waive the fee since it was an error on my end and I have never in the 12 years of having this card asked for an exception. They were very unwilling to help, they placed me on hold on for about 20 minutes trying to locate a supervisor. I was  transferred to corporate. The lady ( did not write her name ) had no empathy and rapidly told me she can help me close my card since I shared with her that this card had no benefit to me due to the large increased interest charges. She did not care to listen to my request.\\nBank of America closed my credit card account on XX/XX/2018 for return payment. I did setup a payment from my external bank checking account to my BOA credit not knowing my checking bank was going to deduct huge amount from my checking which caused the return payment. I have been struggling with my finances since I started my trucking business in XX/XX/2018. It took me almost 90 days to get my first business from shippers as most required my trucking authority to be at least 90 days before they can do business with me. I called Bank of America to resolve the issue but didn\\'t het no help.\\n\"Wells Fargo submitted inaccurate information to the credit agencies. The supposed credit balance they submitted is {$1700.00} with {$1700.00} credit limit. They sent me documents to prove this what I would them. The documents Wells Fargo sent me are inconsistent with what\\'s on the credit reporting bureaus. \\nNo signed credit card agreement. \\nWells Fargo is attempting to justify fake credit card account by showing me overdraft statements from the checking account I had with them. I do not know how that justifies a credit card agreement. \\nThe so-called credit card statements show a credit limit of {$700.00}. Nowhere does it show a credit increase.\"\\nI was shocked when reviewing my credit report and found a late payments on the dates below : 30 days late as of XX/XX/XXXX 60 days late as of XX/XX/XXXX 90 days late as of XX/XX/XXXX 120 days late as of XX/XX/XXXX I am not sure how this happened. I believe I made my payments to you when I received my statements. My only thought is that my statement did not get to me.\\nI was charged {$500.00} by someone using a XXXX account my bank never notified me I dont know this person, I filed a dispute before the funds left my account in hopes to stop the bank from paying the money out to a charge I never authorized. The bank has been taking days to refund me my money but has charged me {$70.00} in over draft fees I feel like Im being robbed again first by the thieves who stole my money and second by the bank who is charging me fees still and I call each day and still no one in the fraud or disputes department has viewed my claim.\\nI attempted to apply for the American Express XXXX XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/2019 on the American Express website. The website was unable to submit my application and kept giving me error messages, on several different devices and internet networks. The welcome bonus offered on the website at the time was XXXX points after spending {$3000.00} in the first 3 months. Being unable to take advantage of this advertised deal online, I called AmEx, and applied for the card over the phone. I made sure to ask if I could receive the same promotion as was advertised online, and was assured I would. The agent then informed me that I had been approved instantly and the card was on its way. After receiving the card, I carefully made the required purchases to qualify for the welcome bonus. In XX/XX/XXXX, I had still not received my welcome bonus, so I called AmEx to inquire about the status of the bonus. I was told that it takes 6 months after opening the card to get the bonus. In XX/XX/XXXX,  more than 6 months after opening the card, I had still not received my bonus. When I called to inquire about this, I was told I had no record of a welcome bonus on my account, and was instead offered XXXX points for my trouble. This is a flagrant example of false advertising and bait-and-switch sales tactics, which resulted in serious financial damages as I wouldnt have spent any money on the card, or even opened the account without this welcome bonus.\\n\"My husband and I were lured into an appointment with XXXX XXXX XXXX/XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XX/XX/18 ) who offered to liquidate our time share. While negotiating they agreed to eliminate charges. When signing the document, I asked why the charges were being added back in, they said it is just how the document had to be written. We went home and discussed it for several days and decided to check the internet and found the company had major complaints on their own website besides an F rating by the XXXX. \\nOn XX/XX/18 spoke with XXXX XXXX XXXX and found that the services cost way less. I contacted Chase Card Services immediately to dispute the charges and emailed XXXX XXXX XXXX  to tell them we were rescinding the agreement. XXXX at Chase card Services told me I would get a temporary credit for 7-10 business days and see how the company responded. The company hadn\\'t  responded in the time frame and I contacted Chase to find out where we were at. That agent told me they had 30 days to respond. At the end of 30 days I contacted Chase again and then I was told the company had a complete billing cycle to respond and they would contact me when the company responded. All during this time, XXXX at XXXX was arguing with me about how much work they had done and that at the end of their services I would have to pay all the money I had been discounted at the meeting. \\nWhen I finally received notification from Chase they stated that we were responsible to pay the company in full that we rescinded outside of the time frame, but we could dispute it further. Our first written ( very long ) dispute was sent certified letter and we were waiting for a response from Chase. A long time had passed so I contacted Chase to see where we were with the dispute. They informed me it was closed because of lack of response from us. I told them I sent it Certified Mail and could prove it. They said okay, we will open it again just send it again. So I did. \\nAgain, they denied our dispute claiming that we were bound by the contract. We sent another dispute further detailing why we shouldn\\'t be held liable. Again, they denied the dispute. Finally we sat down and looked at the Timeshare Resolution Services   part of the contract ( which we initialed ) : XXXX. I/We in the event of rescission of the contract, a 20 % charge will be assessed to recover costs incurred to process the contract*** This is what we agreed upon. So we sent another dispute ( XX/XX/18 ) to Chase Card Services ( we can provide the claim # ) explaining that the only amount we were responsible for was the 20 % which would only be {$1000.00}. And Chase denied us again ( XX/XX/18 ). \\nWhile all this is going on XXXX XXXX XXXX  sends us \"\" Warranty Deed \\'\\' for us to sign to continue the original contract. There were so many unfilled spaces on this contract it might as well have been a target at the shooting range. We sent a copy of it to XXXX XXXX XXXX and they circled a ton of things wrong with the contract and called us to let us know that my husband was actually named as the preparer of the Deed to boot. \\nBoth Chase Card Services and XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) have handled this agreement totally wrong. \\nXXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) are rooking people ( older people like ourselves ) out of hard earned money on the guise that they can effectively terminate a Timeshare Contract when they can\\'t even properly fill out a contract much less provide an appropriate legal service and don\\'t know how to treat customers. \\nChase Card Services has allowed an \"\" unauthorized charge \\'\\' to continue when we have clearly stated rationale that would prove the company is rooking us! \\n\\nI hope I have attached all the files necessary for this to move forward.', \"Synchrony Bank decreased my credit limit with our notifying me.

On XX/XX/XXXX I login to my online account to make a early payment and noticed my available credit was - {$19.00} and my credit limit was decreased to {$640.00}. I received no notice from Synchrony that this  would happen and according to my payment history there is no way I should be in the negative. I have never missed a payment and my payment history is excellent and I have paid much higher than the monthly amount due.

They have committed trust fraud, bank fraud, and securities fraud. Each holding a fine from {>= $1,000,000} to {>= $1,000,000}. I received no benefit which is unauthorized use of my credit card. In order to clarify that there has not been any false claims of securities, illegal securitizations, trades, hypothecating, interest, and proceeds fraud entry misapplied in my name, as benificiary of the account Pursuant to 15 USC 44 Im asserting my rights to acquire documentary evidence for the books of account as defined in IRS 583.

The email does not state specifics, and offers no contact avenue for a  response. I have emailed back twice, and called several times, with no response. With each of these cards come promotional bonus miles, which were all taken away with the closure of the account. There was no gaming/abuse/fraud committed with applying for, and receiving these cards over a multi year period, and I am alarmed that my miles can be taken away with no avenue of response or venue of contact.\\nI am a victim of identity theft and have been a victim of identity theft for over 25 years. Someone stole and used my Citibank Visa credit card account and made fraudulent charges using my credit card account. The balance on the fraudulent account is {$24000.00}. I want Citibank to not hold me liable for the fraudulent charges and send me a new card with a new account number with my credit limit of {$11000.00}. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ) which is federal law, I cant be held liable for fraudulent charges and unauthorized use of my credit card and credit card number. Citibank is violating FCBA by holding me liable for fraudulent and unauthorized charges/transactions on my Citibank Visa credit card account.\\n\"On XX/XX/XXXX I requested a balance transfer in the amount of {$3300.00} from my XXXX XXXX issued by First National Bank of XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX ) in response to a low interest promotion offer into my checking account with \"\" XXXX  \\'\\' bank. \\nI logged into the bank \\'s website and filled in the required information : A - The account number ( where the money will be deposited into ), I entered my debt card number. \\nXXXX - XXXX dollar amount to be transferred ( I entered {$3300.00} ). \\nC - The name of the receiving bank ( I entered \"\" XXXX XXXX \\'\\' ) I then clicked on \"\" Process \\'\\' and received a message that my request was being processed. \\nTwo days later I noticed that the transfer had posted into my XXXX XXXX account along with {$67.00} for Balance Transfer Fee. \\nAfter few days I started checking my checking account with XXXX online to see if the balance transfer had posted into my account to no avail. \\nI called XXXX to inquire and was informed that there was no such deposit received. \\nI called First National Bank of Omaha XXXX Customer Service several times to inquire and was always told to give it XXXX more days, eventually I was advised to allow up to ( XXXX ) business days for the check to arrive. Every time I called the customer service representatives were eager to end the call without actually trying to investigate or do any research. On or around XX/XX/XXXX I pressed the representative to research the system and sure enough she found out that the check had been processed and cashed on XX/XX/XXXX by XXXX and advised me to contact them which I did and was assured that there was no such a check in their system. \\nI called First National Bank back with XXXX \\'s response and was advised by Customer Service to call XXXX again and tell them to have their accounting department call First National of XXXX \\'s accounting department and that they should be able to locate the check. \\nI called XXXX again and relayed First National \\'s request and was told that they would not do that and that the bank that issued the check should be the one to call them. \\nI then asked to speak to a manger who also insisted that the issuing bank is the one that needed to contact them, after a prolonged and heated back and forth discussion with the XXXX \\'s manager I was too agitated to continue and asked him to close my checking account which he did. \\nI called First National again and explained XXXX \\'s position and again the representative insisted that XXXX should be the one to call them, at that point I had wasted several hours between the two banks either waiting for someone to pick up the call or being placed on hold and again the representative was clearly trying to end the call, so I asked to speak to a manger, I was placed on hold again for so long until finally she came back online and advised that the manager was busy and that he would call me later. I waited for a call back to no avail until the following day. The manager was straight forward and extremely rude and bluntly told me that it was my problem together with XXXX and that they did send the check as I requested and that was it for them, I then asked for a copy of the cashed check so that I would have a proof when talking to XXXX again ( bearing in mind that my relationship with XXXX had been terminated ). \\nAgain, I got the same response from XXXX, speaking from one manager to the next and eventually ended the call with no resolution. \\n\\nI called XXXX XXXX again trying dispute the charge since I had not received any funds, however, the agent response was that my issue didn\\'t qualify to be a disputed charge and advised that I needed to speak to the same manager that I had spoken to a couple of days earlier, again that manager, was extremely combative and rude and claimed that I accepted the charge when I pressed ( Process ) initially and that made me responsible and that I had given them the wrong information, and or the wrong address. \\n\\nI started calling several numbers in XXXX for help to no avail, I even initiated another balance transfer from First national Bank into my XXXX  Credit Card ( not the checking account ) in the amount of {$140.00} plus {$10.00} processing fee to verify their process and confirmed that the bank \\'s system does not even require the receiving bank \\'s address unlike what the manager had claimed, after the second balance transfer request was processed, I then realized what went wrong, it turned out that First National Bank had sent the check to the Credit Card Payment Processing Center in XXXXXXXX XXXX instead of the Checking Account Processing Center in XXXX XXXX \\nArmed with the new knowledge I called First NationaXXXX, spoke to the same manager again he was still adamant that it was not his problem but mine so, I asked to speak to his manager, he then advised that he would have her call me the following day. \\nHis manager called me the following day, apparently she had been filled in with her Subordinate \\'s version, that her response was similar to his, I asked her to tell me what I had done wrong, and her response was basically that the issue was out of her bank \\'s hands and there was nothing they could do to retrieve the funds although I kept telling her what XXXX had repeatedly required fort her accounting department to contact them but she wouldn\\'t accept that and insisted that it was out of their hands, well I repeatedly explained to her that it was out of my hands as well and that XXXX would not have anything to do with me being the recipient and that only the issuer should pursue that issue in addition to the fact that my banking relationship with them was terminated. Again, she made it clear that there was nothing they could do and that I was responsible for the funds that I never received and never will and that I was expected to pay it back! \\nI threatened to sue and take them to court but unfortunately everything I said just fell on deaf ears. \\nThis has been going on for over a month and a half, I\\'m XXXX, can\\'t afford an attorney and do not want to ruin my credit because I depend on it plus I borrow student loans for my child to attend college so i need my credit in good standing, please help me or advise me of the best way to handle this dilemma, I needed the money to begin with that\\'s why I wanted a transfer to my checking account, now not only I didn\\'t receive the money that I needed but also I\\'m expected to pay it back. I have been on XXXX since XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX and making ends meet is extremely hard as it is to add even more burden to my finances unjustly for a mistake I didn\\'t commit just because they can. \\nI trust you will stand up for justice and see to it that justice is served. \\nThank you in advance for your attention to this matter. \\n\\nGod bless you all and God bless America.\"\\nI was shocked when I reviewed my credit report and found late payment on the date below : XX/XX/2018 I am not sure how this happened, I believe that I had made my payments to you when I received my statements. My only thought is that my monthly statement did not get to me.\\n\"good afternoon, the first time I come across this. Not professionalism, and even more so I did not expect. See this from representatives of the bank for which they work in the United States. Around XX/XX/XXXX, I made purchases with HSBC Cash Rewards Mastercard XXXX credit card and everything was fine. \\nThe next day I discovered that I could not find my card - which I suppose was dropped or was stolen in a store. I Immediately Contacted HSBC Support in Mobile Chat. I asked to block the card and send me a new one. \\nA few days later I saw transaction XXXX XXXX # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$660.00}. The transaction was made 50-100 miles from my city. After that, I again turned to Support in a mobile chat - and the representative AGAIN assured me that I should not worry, and that the card was blocked. At the time of contacting them, there were no Foreign transactions in my balance sheet. When asked why the transaction appeared on XXXX, he could not answer. The representative assured me that he opened Fraud Claim - and this will be processed within 10 days. After about 2 weeks - I did not receive a response from them and was forced to turn to mobile chat for the third time. I was given a phone number where I needed to call to clarify the status. I called the phone number that was given to me - The bank representative said that I did NOT have more than one open Fraud Claim, and she would make a NEW one - more than a month after my first contact with HSBC. I described the whole situation 5 times - and I was assured that I did not need to worry - and that I would not receive this amount in my Bills. It took about 6 weeks from the first appeal - they never contacted me, I called them for the 6th time and they connected me to the Claim department - they said that the investigation is still in progress, and I have to wait - I asked for a temporary loan so that my credit rate fell - but they refused - total about 6 weeks they cant deal with one transaction? After that I still called them 6th 7th 8 and 9 times with a request to connect me with the supervisor or give me a clear explanation of what was happening - they promised me that the supervisor would call me, but this was not done. Ill call 10 and talk with 10 representatives of XXXX and other foreign countries - I realized that this makes no sense. They just dont comply with the terms of their policy, I dont understand how this bank generally got a license in the United States. Later I was informed that my request was rejected. my attempts to find out at least some information or explanations - they ended up simply connecting me to a number that did not answer. 1 ) My question is why the promised protection was not implemented ( We\\'ve got you covered with Fraud Alerts As an HSBC customer, you\\'re automatically enrolled in our Fraud Alert program. If we have your mobile number or email on file, you\\'ll automatically be notified of suspicious transaction activity on your HSBC Debit or Credit Card Account.

You can then verify the purchase with a simple text or email reply so you can continue using your card or report it as fraud. If fraud is suspected, we may need to speak with you. 1 ) Why didnt I receive any SMS or E-mail - when {$660.00} was stolen from my card? 2 ) Why does the bank refuse to provide any explanation or to connect me with employees from the USA? 3 ) Why the Bank Refuses to Perform Fraud Protection As an HSBC in our fraud alert program. Point 2 which contains 2 Have peace of mind knowing that HSBC Bank USA, N.A. won\\'t hold you responsible for unauthorized transactions. As an HSBC Debit or Credit cardholder, Zero Liability applies to your purchases made with your U.S.-issued Debit or Credit card in the store, over the telephone, online, or via a mobile device.

To learn more about additional protections with respect to unauthorized transactions, please contact HSBC by calling the number on the back of your card. Zero Liability does not apply to the following ( or certain ) Mastercard payment cards : Commercial cards, unregistered prepaid cards or gift cards. 4 ) I Demand Immediately to Understand this situation, and remove this transaction from my balance.

Customer Service explained that my account was closed due to poor credit but my credit has actually improved since opening my account, so this explanation doesn\\'t make any sense. Upon further review, I\\'ve seen hundreds of complaints from people who have had their accounts closed in the same manner over the past few days.

The website directed me to call in to complete the application and provided a reference number : XXXX. When I called in I was asked for my physical address since I provided a PO Box for the application and the financial institution is required to have a physical address on file. I provided my address but emphasized that there is no mail delivery at the address and that my PO Box would need to be used for everything - the physical address is only for their records. The representative said he understood. After he ran my credit he said my application was denied and that they would be mailing me a letter with the reason. \\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I received an email asking me to click on a link, provide my reference number, and verify some personal information to access the response. I was able to provide the information and authenticate but the page that came up was blank ( I was accessing it from my mobile device as I do not have another computer ). I found a computer I could use to access the letter and it said I was declined because the address provided did not match my credit report. \\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I called them back to ask if they could rerun my credit using my PO Box . Since I don't get mail at my physical address it doesn't appear on my credit report anywhere and can not be verified that way. After speaking with a supervisor I was informed that federal regulations require that they be able to verify my physical address, and that they can only do so using a credit report. \\nI find this to be a discriminatory practice. People living in rural areas who do not receive mail at a physical address are disproportionately affected by requiring that their physical address be available on their credit report when creditors report information using the address they mail statements and notices to. Also, a consumer has very little control over what a creditor reports to the credit bureaus, and no way besides a dispute to add or update information that the credit bureaus have on file. \\nIn short, I don't get mail here, I can't tell the credit bureaus that I live here, my creditors don't provide my physical address to the credit bureaus, and Synchrony Bank won't validate a physical address by any means other an inquiry to the credit bureaus.

I was charged over {$1600.00} not including interest for this fee. When I called to inquiry about this fee I was  told that I signed up for it in XXXX when I opened the account and they would only refund me {$360.00}. They also said they give its customers 30 days to review and dispute charges.

When I checked my statements, I noticed it only goes back as far as XX/XX/XXXX and it was opened in XX/XX/XXXX ( 1 year 5 month difference ). I think that is weird because I have another credit card and it shows my statements from when I opened the card in XXXX and I had that card 2 years longer than the Discover Card. I researched it to see if others were having the same issues and they were! Many people are saying that Discover placed this payment protection plan on their account without their authorization. So, I reached out to Discovers Executive Office on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX was my case worker. I explained everything to him and he said he would get back to me within a week. He called back on XX/XX/XXXX ( a little over 2 weeks from when I called ) and said that I did sign up for the payment protection plan when I opened the card, the charge was on my statements, and I was sent a yearly newsletter ( separate from the statements ) reminding me of the charge. I didn\\'t recall seeing any newsletter, so I asked him when was the last time I received it and  he said XX/XX/XXXX. My response was send me a copy of the newsletter I was sent in XXXX ( 6 months ago ) and something showing that I signed up for this in XXXX. He replied that he could not because that was a long time ago and his records dont go back that far! So, I said since you cant show me then who can, he said no one! So if you could see I signed up for it in XXXX and that I received a yearly newsletter in XX/XX/XXXX, how you cant show it to me when you just said you seen it. Im not just going to take your word for it. He kept going back to the statements. But, he even admitted that he dont check his statements. Furthermore, it being on the statement doesnt mean that I signed up for it. They cant prove I signed up for it. I did a XXXX  claim ( # XXXX ) and XXXX was assigned as the case worker. I asked him for proof that I signed up for this charge, and he ignored my request.

While in XX/XX/2019, I received a letter from U.S. Bancorp stating my Visa credit card had been closed because of inactivity. I called U.S. Bancorp to see how they would deal with my {$100.00} rewards dollars. According to them, because of account closure, they would not be able to redeem rewards dollars for me. But the issue is, before they made the decision to close my dormant account, they never informed me in advance. Therefore I had no chance to redeem the rewards dollars before the closure. It is unfair to me as I didn't violate any terms & conditions of this Visa credit card and I didn't request to close this account. The action of U.S. Bancorp is fraudulent as it is not reasonable to decline my request to redeem my rewards dollars.\", 'On XX/XX/XXXX, we purchased a 5 Day XXXX XXXX package through Costco Travel using our Citibank Costco Visa credit card for {$1700.00}.

In the first situation, my account was paid in full and I had a zero balance. This time, my account was not even close to the credit limit. I have never missed a payment and have been a customer for years. The company is completely crooked and seems to be doing this to a lot of their customers. The company is using the COVID-19 pandemic in order to clear out customers. It is not right. I have done nothing wrong, and do not deserve to lose available credit. In addition, the credit score they pulled has changed as I had a mistake on it that was recently fixed.\\nI paid off my credit card balance in full, and then saw a mysterious charge that was NOT made by me. I contacted Capital One twice, and the charge is still there. Furthermore, they have not closed this card down, which makes me vulnerable to more attacks. Something is very wrong about this, and I need help fighting for my rights to get the protection from fraud that Cap One should be providing without me having to go to this trouble. I\\'m interested in also filing a complaint about Cap One using off shore call centers to handle calls about fraud, and how this problem has escalated as a result.\\n\"To whom it may concern, I am submitting this complaint regards to a transaction in the amount of {$660.00} made on my Wells Fargo Cash Wise Visa card ending in XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX ( Dispute # XXXX ). \\n\\nI am owed a full refund on this purchase as the merchant did NOT provide the services that had been promised. Effectively, the merchant charged me for services that they did NOT provide. I had to pay the merchant before any services could possibly be rendered. However, after paying the merchant the full amount, the merchant FAILED to deliver and repair my vehicle as promised. And now, they\\'re trying to claim money ( {$660.00} ) that does NOT belong to them as they rendered NO services. \\n\\nI contacted the merchant on XX/XX/XXXX and they confirmed via email that a full refund IS owed. \\n\\nI would like a full refund at this time as I will NOT be paying {$660.00} to a merchant that did NOT provide the services that had been promised. That is beyond deceitful and moves into the territory of fraud. As such, I expect a full refund especially since the merchant themselves had now confirmed that a FULL refund is owed.', 'I applied for a XXXX XXXX Card through Barclay \\'s because of the promotion stated below. \\n\"\" The XXXX XXXX Card will allow you to earn XXXX bonus points after spending {$1000.00} on purchases ( that are not later returned or rescinded ) with your XXXX XXXX Card within 90 days of opening your credit card account and paying the annual fee.

The first time I called XX/XX/2019 I was told that if there is no activity no statement is created. I called again on XX/XX/2019 and was given the same reason but when I mentioned that a payment was made I was then told that they were having problems.\"\\nWe ordered an on-line streaming service ( one year subscription ) from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX using our Barclay \\'s XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Mastercard. We were charged twice for the service, each in the amount of {$99.00}, for a total charge of {$190.00}. The service was cancelled by XXXX XXXX XXXX  who confirmed the cancellation in writing. We disputed the charge through the credit card company with the supporting evidence of cancellation. Despite this, the credit card company reinstated the charges and we have paid them in full. We believe it is incorrect for the credit card company to charge us for a service which the provider itself confirms was cancelled.\\n\"I had opened a Capital One MasterCard credit card about two years ago. On XX/XX/XXXX, I decided to apply for a new credit card due to a promotional bonus and also needing a Visa CC for Costco Gas. The credit card was approved and days later, my existing card was restricted. No email, call, text, or notification. After calling in several times XXXX and XXXX, was told I had to complete a verification that my social security number belonged to me before both of my accounts could be unrestricted ( Form SSA-89 which is Authorization for the SSA to release social security number verification ). Note I have joint savings and checking accounts with my husband at Capital One with thousands in deposits as well. \\n\\nI receive this form in XXXX ( now 1+ month later ) and sign and send it back. XX/XX/XXXX and they have not received the form accordingly to them. No clear answer as to what\\'s happening at this point, only that they need the form signed to verify my SSN belongs to me. Capital One resends the letter and provides me with an emailed link to upload a copy of the XX/XX/XXXX letter I had mailed. Apparently the copy I uploaded did not suffice as it needed to be signed within 30 days ( even though the form states the consent is valid for 90 days ). I used the link to also upload my passport, green card, social security card copy, XXXX IRS tax transcripts, NJDL, gas bill, cable bill, and documentation from XXXX, all of which support my name, address, DOB, and SSN ( my full identity ). This is now in XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nBeginning of XXXX ( about the XXXX ), no response, call, email, or text from Capital One still. Sign on to online banking and see that now BOTH of the credit cards are closed. I\\'ve now called in over 15 times and spent countless hours on the phone trying to rectify the situation. I even offered to go to a Capital One branch to show my identification in person to verify my identity. I\\'ve gone above and beyond to prove my identity and even continue to have no issues with my existing Capital One deposit accounts and over 5 different banks I also use. I call in and am told my credit card is closed and the fraud department was unable to verify my name matches with my social security number. A representative offers to assist me by personally handling the matter and to this day, I have not had a response from her. She simply stated my name does not match my SSN per the social security administration information they received. I asked her to confirm they ran the name and number correctly. No response as of yet on this. She asked me to go to the local social security office, which I did about a week later to request a letter validating my SSN belongs to me as Capital One recommended. \\n\\nThe SSA states they do not provide letters as my SSN belongs to me and my SS card is my proof of this. I\\'ve already provided this to Capital One. I call in and advise the same. I also ask for a new link to upload additional supporting docs and ask for the same rep that assisted me to please call me back. Multiple calls asking for her to call me back have gone unanswered. I received the link ( still XX/XX/XXXX ) and uploaded additional supporting documentation, including mySocialSecurity website printout showing I\\'m enrolled and that my SSN, name, and address all correspond to the information Capital One has received from me. I also uploaded my XXXX tax refund that I\\'d just filed with my husband in its entirety along with the XXXX from my employer. Not my direct deposit goes into the Capital One checking account that is STILL opened to this day. How is it possible that Capital One will close out my credit cards because \"\" my social security number doesn\\'t belong to me \\'\\' but leave my deposit accounts opened where I have thousands of dollars deposited? \\n\\nThis is terrible business practice. Seems to be more convenient to keep my deposits when it benefits them. Note I also have NEVER made a late payment or carried balances, which ALL of the reps I spoke to confirmed as well. There were no prior issues at all with the account. to this day ( XX/XX/XXXX ), Capital One has not responded at all to my inquiries. Every time I call I\\'m told the documentation I provided is still being reviewed. I had even uploaded my a new picture of my social security card and the supporting documents ( passport, driver \\'s license, green card, tax transcripts, etc ... ) back in XX/XX/XXXX. I have never been so ashamed and embarrassed to have to \"\" beg \\'\\' for assistance so many times. Terrible, terrible customer service and follow-up. No accountability whatsoever. After bringing Capital One so much business over the years ( and I still have a banking relationship with them as does my husband, who has 3 credit cards actively being used and in good standing - one of which I\\'m an authorized signer on, ironically ), this is how they treat me? Truly disappointing and unacceptable. \\n\\nIf I was impersonating someone, why would I continue to \"\" expose \\'\\' myself by submitting so much supporting documentation supporting my identity? Why would I volunteer to go to a Capital One branch to show face and verify the original documentation in person? Why hasn\\'t Capital One accepted me going in person to verify my government-issued identification? There are so many disconnects that I still can not believe this is happening today. \\n\\nI even emailed the CEO last week and to this day - no response. At this point, I don\\'t even know what to do to try and get a straight answer. There is just no customer service. Capital One has NEVER sent me any correspondence whatsoever related to my accounts being frozen or eventually being closed. They REFUSE to assist me and provide customer service. I am STILL a customer and continue to have thousands of dollars in deposits with them under MY NAME with MY SSN, which they say does not belong to me and as a result closed out my two credit cards? This doesn\\'t make sense. Someone or multiple individuals are not doing their job. These are unfair business practices that are taking place and bad customer service, which shows they truly do not care about assisting their customers and only continue to provide the services that truly benefit their bottom line, in this case, thousands in deposit balances.', 'This is the 3rd Credit Card of XXXX XXXX XXXX I am writing about because all these people have all forms of XXXX XXXX XXXX using my \"\" MULTIPLE ADDRESSES \\'\\' and these CEOs let them.

I have been told that if i do not make the min of {$270.00} they will continue to hit me with past due fees and continue to report me as late. I guarantee if I was late with no payment made at all I would have received multiple phones calls harassing me to make my payment. However, I was short by {$18.00} and this bank took the route of charging me outrageous fees and boxing me into a corner to pay them or my credit will continue to be hurt as well as I am losing out on money they are falsely charging me for.

Later that day, I talked to him on the phone about my finding and returned the products two days later. I contacted Chase Bank to dispute charges at the same time. Chase Bank Dispute Dept. credited my account, so I closed the card in XX/XX/XXXX. But I found the charges came back in XX/XX/XXXXstatement with the new credit card number that I had never received. I called Chase Bank, the supervisor told me the charges were fromXX/XX/XXXX, because the seller told the Bank he did not talk to me, and he was not sure if the products were returned, so he would not refund. It was a lie. But Chase Bank believed and paid him. The supervisor explained they sent me an electronic letter on XX/XX/XXXX to request the proof of returned products. I told her I did not receive the letter at all, otherwise I would have provided all the evidences. Also, I told her I did not have online access to that account anymore at that time because the account was closed. How was I supposed to get the letter she talked about? She said she could not re-open the case because it's passed the timeframe. Then she hung up on me. It was so rude. It's definitely a negligence from the bank since they did not acknowledge or re-verify with me for the fraudster 's charges of total of {$2900.00}. \\n\\nI submitted a letter onXX/XX/XXXX to Chase Bank Compliant Escalation with all the evidences I have with the seller including text conversations and proof of returns on XX/XX/XXXX andXX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nI am not going to pay the charges because Chase Bank paid the merchant without my authorization or confirmation.

You could see the adjustments made on 4 statements from Chase Bank that had never been correct. \\n\\nI have been with Chase Bank for more than 8 years, always been a good customer, receiving good and pleasant services. But now I am shocked and traumatized so I am complaining Chase Bank had a lack of procedures in place that are designed to provide me with rights and protections against fraud, misuse and misrepresentation.\", 'An automatic payment that had been scheduled for my Bank of America credit card was scheduled prior to the payment date. This automatic payment did not withdraw from my account automatically. Their website and app told me the pending payment would be deducted in the amount of the minimum balance due. They did not deduct this payment, and offered the explanation that their autopay system sometimes takes a few cycles to \"\" kick in, \\'\\' and that I should have known this. This is not told to the customer in fact, the opposite is, both explicitly and implicitly, given the fact they they refer to these payments as automatic, and show the payment as pending with the due date. \\n\\nThe wording of the bank \\'s website and confirmation emails does not say anything about there being a period where automatic payments will not work as promised. In fact, their emails, when they are sent out, promise the payment would be made on the next due date. They require the customer to opt-in to receiving any kind of email, but they display this information on their website. Their website reported that the payment would be deducted on the due date. Their records, if they are as the representative claimed to me, are incomplete and inconsistent with information given to the on their website. \\n\\nWhen I called the bank, they told me that this takes a few cycles to work as promised, and they will not waive the fee because I could have paid it manually. No other credit card bank works this way ; the industry standard is for automatic payments to begin on the date when they are scheduled. The bank also expected me to know this without being told. This is a limitation of their system which is not typical of this industry. The representative of the bank I spoke with claimed that it is common sense that automatic payments do not always happen immediately. Other banks, including XXXX XXXX and XXXX, do not work this way. Their expectation is that I should have seen a promise to deduct on a certain date, and known that this may not happen as the promised. That is the opposite of common sense. Automatic payments are supposed to be automatic, and to have them work any other way is deceptive. Manual payments can be made on the due date and be received in time, so there is an expectation that automatic payments made before the due date would work the same. \\n\\nThe automatic payment is for the minimum balance due, which can be a small amount or even XXXX, so even when I monitor my checking account, not seeing my checking account balance decrease significantly does not mean I should not have expected the payment was not satisfied. Their promise is that they will take the amount due each cycle from my checking account, even if that amount is XXXX dollars. \\n\\nThe bank \\'s autopay system is also unusually difficult to navigate for the industry. For example, in their mobile app, they offer a virtual assistant to which the customer can ask basic questions. When asked to set up an automatic payment, it does not direct the customer to a screen where this can be done. The automatic payment to which this complaint refers is one I set up after a previous one, which had been working, suddenly stopped working without warning or notification from the bank. \\n\\nThe bank \\'s autopay system promises automatic payments on a certain date, but they do not always fulfill this promise, and the bank expects customers to know this without being told. The bank \\'s policies are deceptive. There was a promise to do something at a date. This promise was unfulfilled by the bank, and they expect me to pay a fee for their failure.\"\\nApplied for Bank of America credit card and was denied for reasons not described in conditions on their application. I was denied because I didnt bank at Bank of America. The application did not state that I had to have an open checking or savings account at Bank of America to be approved for the credit card. The denial lowered my credit score along with the hard inquiry for the card they were not going to approve even with my excellent credit score.\\nI received a call from XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX claiming they were with the FBI and that my identity had been stolen and my social security number needed to be changed.

When I used the card on the XX/XX/XXXXit was fine. When I went to withdraw from the card on the XX/XX/XXXXto pay my rent and utilities ... I was unable to use the card. In fact the message I received was that I was not an authorized user. I thought perhaps it was a glitch so I attempted to use the card at a store where it was denied. I then called the number on the back to obtain my balance and was immediately sent to a recording and placed on hold for over two hours and then hung up on. This has happened multiple times over the last 2 days. Today on XX/XX/XXXX I attempted to withdraw from the card again and received the same message so I attempted to set up an account on their website to find out what was going on with my card only to be unable to do so. The card is completely locked and the website states that all my information is wrong. I have attemped to contact DirectExpress countless times at all hours, I have contacted the bank Comerica Bank that issues the cards ( only to be told they have no access to the accounts ), I have contacted the XXXX XXXX XXXX, and am now contacting you. I have literally reached a dead end and have no idea what to do at this point. I currently have a call into my governor, congressman, and my attorney as I genuinely feel this may be a case of internal fraud.

She said I would not see the 20 % discounts on my receipts but would see them on my statement. So I applied and received the credit card. I was only given a printout that served as a temporary card for that day. It did not have the terms of the card on it. I purchased a number of items and then went home and was dismayed to find that there was no credit card number on the paper given so could not purchase more from home. \\nHowever, when I got the statement I saw that the item I purchased when the credit card was specifically offered to me did not have a 20 % discount but instead only a {$17.00} discount on a {$290.00} item ( {$320.00} with tax ). The other items had the 20 % discount applied. I called XXXX XXXX Customer Service and asked about this and they said there is a {$100.00} limit on the discount.

( Screenshot of this discussion is attached as XXXX ) XX/XX/XXXX : When my card had no other balance, I made an additional {$1000.00} payment in hopes of lowering the monthly Plan It amount due and lower the monthly payment as previously advised as it would help me with my monthly cash flow. I did notice until later, but this actually did not lower my monthly payment, instead it lowered the Plan It to 5 payments/5 months left, ahead of schedule. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX : Received XXXX statement ( Statement attached as Statement XXXX ) XX/XX/XXXX : Paid XXXX statement, and afterwards realized that the amount due for Plan It did not change, that instead a month had been removed from the term length, but I still had a Plan It payment due with this statement despite my earlier payment. Effectively this moved my final payment date 1 month earlier then expected. 4 payments/months in Pay It term remaining out of 9 total payments, even though only 4 months have passed. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX : After realizing the above, I contacted customer support again via their desktop website, to try and clear things up. Mentioned that things didn\\'t happen as I expected from what they told me and would rather have the payments lowered with the original term lengths, or my {$1000.00} refunded and the month added back to my Plan It. I was again repeatedly lied to. The first representative told me he looked at the previous chat, and said I was told things that I was not, evidenced by the XX/XX/XXXX screenshot. This then got escalated to a manager who continued to lie to me and told me a month had not been removed from the Plan It, and that the {$1000.00} payment did not go to the Plan It, despite their website and statements clearly stating otherwise. If you look at my XXXX statement at the bottom of page XXXX, it very clearly shows that my payment is {$820.00} per month, and that {$1800.00} was paid towards it in XXXX. I did mis-speak during this interaction thinking that my original final payment was in XXXX, because at the time, I thought my first payment was XXXX. This was inaccurate. As noted above, first payment was in XXXX, so original final payment would be in XXXX, and due to the extra payment current final payment was moved up to XXXX. Customer service said they were willing to refund me the {$1000.00}, but they were not willing to add that balance back to the Plan It or add back the 1 month term to the Plan It even though it had been removed, meaning that {$1000.00} would be due again at my next statement instead of on the Plan It schedule like it was originally. They have effectively moved my due dates forward 1 month, and refuse to put them back to the original dates. \\n\\nThis full interaction is attached via XXXX screenshots of their desktop website chat client labeled with the date followed by a number XXXX through XXXX which denotes the sequence they happened. Everywhere possible, I tried to leave some overlap of the messages so that you could match them up and follow the sequence to ensure nothing was left out. These screenshots are in the attached XXXX file. \\n\\nAdditional Notes : I\\'ve searched the various Plan It documents and the AmEx website, and how extra payments does not seem to be detailed officially anywhere. I find the fact that they don\\'t disclose this while customer service is actively lying about it, and then moving your due dates forward to be dishonest, immoral, and predatory.', \"see attatched XX/XX/2019 statement confirms on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX posted a credit of {$200.00} & {$280.00} USAA posted Temporary Credits THERE CAN NOT BE 2 CREDITS FOR ONE PURCHASE!!!!!!

During that time I had set up alerts on my card if transactions were made I would know about them. My son made 7 small transactions with XXXX during the first month he had the card and before the first statement was issued. Whereas I was notified of the charges which were between $ XXXX- {$10.00} Barclays never notified me through alerts that they were applying a {$10.00} Cash Advance Fee to each charge. For example, a XXXX charge was done on XX/XX/XXXX for {$1.00} and Barclays charged a {$10.00} Cash Advance fee without alert. No other credit card treats XXXX transactions as Cash Advances. XXXX XXXX charges 3 % of the total transaction for example. Barclays never notified me they were treating them as Cash Advances in any Agreement or through the alert system I had set up with them. At the end of the month when I received the bill I contacted Barclays and was told under no circumstance despite their deceptive practices they would remove the charges. I spoke to multiple representatives and supervisors who were rude, obnoxious and completely unprofessional. As a result I cancelled my card which I had for years without incident and refused to pay the bill. I\\'m willing to pay the bill less the {$70.00} in unlawful charges but Barclays has instead now decided to wreck my perfect credit. I\\'m asking the CFPB to look into the deceptive practices of Barclay \\'s on cash advances with XXXX and have them remove this information from my credit report. Barclay \\'s has probably collected millions of dollars from thousands of customers with this deceptive practice.\"\\nI gave access to XXXX XXXX XXXX to my Wells Fargo and XXXX XXXX credit cards to transfer funds to me. I got cash advances and wrote balance transfer checks and XXXX XXXX  XXXX agreed to make payments to the credit card companies to pay for the withdrawals. They made payments initially but then reversed the payments. The reversals resulted in my card credit limits being exceeded by a factor of 3.5. Wells Fargo notified me that my card account had been closed and that the balance was - {$170.00}. I requested them to send me a check to take the balance to XXXX and they did. Shortly after, the balance went to - {$25000.00} after XXXX XXXX  XXXX reversed their payment. The credit limit on the account was {$17000.00}. The credit limit on the XXXX account was {$20000.00}. The balance soared to {$72000.00} after XXXX XXXX   XXXX reversed their account payments. One payment that was reversed was for {$52000.00}. XXXX XXXX XXXX took similar actions with my XXXX XXXX account. The account credit limit was {$20000.00} and the account balanced soared to {$57000.00} after their account payments were reversed.\\n\"During the course of approximately one year ( between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ) I signed up for multiple Citibank products which offered promotional XXXX XXXX ( XXXX  ) miles. This included personal credit cards, a business credit card, and a personal checking account. On each of these applications, I provided my own name, social security number, AA Aadvantage number and was approved by Citibank. For all of these accounts, I met the terms and conditions outlined by Citibank and was awarded the promotional miles after meeting each of the required activities. However, on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX has without notice or warning, terminated my Aadvantage rewards account and has confiscated XXXX miles that I have earned due to my relationship with Citibank. I have attached an actual photo of a physical credit card offer I used to apply to a personal Citibank credit card and was approved for ; the terms state the offer is for \"\" new accounts only \\'\\' and \"\" Your eligibility for a particular product and service is subject to a final determination by Citibank \\'\\'. Citibank determined that each new account with a different credit card number is a \"\" new account \\'\\' and approved me as such. I want to point out that I fulfilled all terms with Citibank and Citibank did not terminate my account, XXXX XXXX did. I see on Citibank \\'s current website that terms for Aadvantage credit cards contain new language about not being eligible to receive a new account bonus if one had been received in the past 48 months. However, this language was not on the personal credit card, business credit card, or checking account applications that I applied for at the time and I believe that XXXX XXXX is illegally trying to retroactively enforce these rules. If I were to directly purchase the XXXX miles in my account that were confiscated from XXXX XXXX, it would cost over {$16000.00} so I consider their termination of my account using unfair business practices amounts to grand theft. I was honest on all my credit card and checking account applications, followed Citibank \\'s terms and conditions, thus the accusation of \"\" fraud, misrepresentation, abuse \\'\\' from XXXX XXXX does not apply to me and they do not have grounds to terminate my Aadvantage account. I also want it to be known that I paid real money to Citibank on its Aadvantage products, including account maintenance fees and interest charges because I was using these products with the belief that I was part of the Aadvantage program and I would receive benefits such as earning Aadvantage miles. The fact that XXXX XXXX terminated my Aadvantage account for using these Citibank products is misleading and unfair to consumers.\"\\nI havent received my Way2Go card in the mail yet and already submitted an other complaint and they resolved it by sending me another card that will be here tomorrow but I was wondering if I could get you all to rather just take the balance thats on my Way2Go card and deposit it into my direct deposit account\\nI paid {$30.00} on this account, which was the amount due every month, before the due date.i was promised a increased, for no apparent reason, in addition to being charged {$99.00} a year and {$10.00} a month.Well after I made the payment, of $ XXXX.I decided to close this account.

Additionally, foreign transaction fees of {$6.00} per transaction was charged. I called to request a refund of fees and a credit and the service agent was not helpful.\\nI paid off the majority of my credit card : Freedom from Chase. I have never had a late payment with them. As soon as the pandemic for Cornavirus hit, Chase decided to reduce my credit limit drastically. I have not used my credit card, but this has damaged my debt to credit ratio drastically. According to Chase they reduced my credit limit from a credit report that was pulled on XXXX XXXX, before the pandemic. They decided to reduce my limit until I paid it off and the pandemic hit.\\n\"Since 2015, i have been using \"\" XXXX  XXXX \\'\\' store card to purchase goods at XXXX.

Citi-Bank ( Holder of Home Depot accounts ) stated that I \"\" NEVER REGISTERED THIS ACCOUNT \\'\\'. If I \"\" NEVER REGISTERED THE ACCOUNT \\'\\', then how did I \"\" AGREE TO PAPERLESS STATEMENTS \\'\\'? You MUST be \"\" REGISTERED \\'\\' in order to receive \"\" PAPERLESS STATEMENTS \\'\\'. \\n\\nHome Depot stated that I signed up for \"\" Paperless Statements \\'\\' to receive my monthly bills, & that I also agreed to paying ONLY the \"\" minimum amount due \\'\\' to be withdrawn from my bank account ( XXXX XXXX ) monthly. These are false statements, for I never agreed to have my Home Depot account # ending in XXXX follow these guidelines. They have been taking between {$60.00} & {$90.00} out of my XXXX  account # ending in XXXX since XXXX, XXXX. I would NOT notice these small amounts taken out for 3 reasons : 1st : When I log-on to my XXXX XXXX the first thing I see is my checking balance, & then I go to \"\" BILL PAY \\'\\' ; Open my \"\" PAPER \\'\\' bills, from OTHER \"\" PAYEES \\'\\' = Pay them. \\n2nd : When I look at my \"\" Checking Statement \\'\\', I see \"\" CHECK XXXX \\'\\' under the heading \\'description \\', & - {$84.00} under the heading \\'Debit/Credit \\'.

That\\'s the system for ANY written check. How do I know whether/not my wife didn\\'t write the check. \\n3rd : It\\'s really NOT a SUBSTANTIAL amount of money, that could be EASILY overlooked. Which helps Home Depot & leads into the following. \\nI believe they used a system of deceptive techniques prior XX/XX/XXXX : 1 ) I paid previously by phone to pay a bill & gave them my XXXX XXXX routing & account numbers. They now have these numbers. \\n2 ) Since I buy goods utilizing their 6,12, or 24 month NO INTEREST PROMOTION plans, they waited until I was well into ( +/- a few months ) paying off the 1st PROMO.

I have 6 cards with capital one and I called and it was a one hour wait or maybe longer to speak with an agent. She was very uncaring about the matter so I requested a supervisor who said she has no authority to fix anything or put my account back to the credit limit I had which was XXXX. She spoke in a way to me that seem to be a social injustice and racially motivated. I feel as though I was discriminated against while talking to the supervisor. I have excellent credit with a very high income and have always had a good relationship with capital one until today. Sir, this reducing of random credit limits during a pandemic especially is really unethical and immoral business practices, no other bank has treated me this way ever. This will affect some peoples credit scores that have done nothing wrong to deserve this kind of treatment. My card now has a XXXX limit which is not even useable compared to my other lenders limits and they treat me as a valued customer. I understand these are challenging times in todays world. But, this leaves a bad taste in my mouth with capital one. I have worked hard over the years to have the credit profile I maintain and am very proud of my financial success. I also would like to challenge this to the fair credit reporting act as I did nothing wrong to deserve my credit limit being reduced drastically. I am having a great deal of XXXX  and XXXX XXXX over this matter todayI wonder how long before capital one starts slashing my other card limits. This is much unneeded stress given these challenging times. I will pursue XXXX injustice if someone does not look into why this had to be done to my account that is 12 years old.

Please assist me in resolving this matter. Thanks in advance for your time and help! No executive office response, but an agent called today XXXX and he was very rude and unprofessional. He said you can request a credit limit increase which means he is really not in the executive office. The executive office is the only one who can increase a limit back if this happens for no reason. i TOLD HIM THERE ARE PAGES UPON PAGES OF PEOPLE BEING AFFECTED BY THIS BANKS UNETHICAL AND IMMORAL BUSINESS PRACTICES. He responded with : if you do not like what we have done then you can always leave. What a professional response and class act. This agent was lying from the very beginning as he could not prove he was in the executive office. He called because i also complained to their social media website with posts. Is Capital One in financial trouble? Why have they suddenly decided to try to ruin consumers good credit ratings? They have no legitimate reason for taking this action as they admitted this to me. I took 12 1/2 years of letting this card grow and they destroyed that in one day. On behalf of all consumers this needs to be investigated ... just read all the pages of unhappy consumers stunned that Capital one is out to ruin credit scores and for no valid reason. This should be referred to the FTC. They further stated they expect a consumer to run up a tab on your credit card and if not then that justifies decreasing your credit limit.

My Comenity XXXX XXXX account was now past due with the amount of {$920.00} plus fees. \\n\\nI contacted Comenity regarding the mistake they made in the posting of my XXXX XXXX payment. Furthermore, as instructed by Comenity, I disputed the overdue charges of {$920.00} on my XXXX XXXX account in writing. I provided written evidence that Comenity had mis-posted my XXXX XXXX payment of {$920.00} to my XXXX XXXX account that now had a negative balance of {$920.00}. \\n\\nXXXX agreed that they had made a mistake and would make the corrections to ensure the {$920.00} payment would be applied correctly to my XXXX XXXX account along with removing any interest accrued and late fees. In doing so, Comenity was to remove the credit balance from the XXXX XXXX account. \\n\\nComenity made another mistake while trying to correct its first mistake of the mis-posted payment. In trying to correct the mistake, Comenity then double charged back my XXXX XXXX account and then double credited my XXXX XXXX account. At this point, I now had a negative balance of {$920.00} on my XXXX XXXX account and a positive balance of {$920.00} on my XXXX XXXX account. \\n\\nI called the XXXX XXXX to attempt to advise them of the second mistake and that I did not owe any money on the XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX card. This was Comenity making continued mis-postings to my accounts. I was advised that it would be corrected by the Comenity representative. Unfortunately, it was not corrected, and I called again. Again, I was advised it would be corrected and it was not. I was then sent a check by Comenity for my negative balance on my XXXX XXXX account. \\n\\nI advised the representative that I would not cash the check, because the money is not mine. The representative said that they would put a stop payment on the check and correct the two account balances to where both would be {$0.00}. Again, this did not happen. \\n\\nI do not owe Comenity any money on either account. Furthermore, I will not provide Comenity any money. This is all due to Comenity making multiple mistakes regarding my original payment that was to be applied to my XXXX XXXX account. Comenity has shown a lack of regard in even trying to correct its multiple mistakes and has now wrongly reported late payments to my credit reports. Comenity could easily resolve this issue, but has chosen to not even try to figure it out. Please ask Comenity what are the charges that resulted in the balance of {$920.00} on my XXXX XXXX account. There are no charges on that account. Only Comenity \\'s continued mis-postings.', 'The following charges were reported as never being authorized to the credit card company multiple times starting XX/XX/XXXX and were not made by me or my wife.

Between XX/XX/XXXX and today, 4 withdrawals of {$160.00} have been debited from my account with 4 insuffient funds fees of $ XXXXXXXX/each. Managers and representatives said they could not stop the withdrawals and that I scheduled the payments online. I explained to them that I have not scheduled any web payments since Ive been unemployed and that I explained to the representative that I can not make the payments and interested in the hardship program. The managers/representatives were rude and placed me on hold for long periods of time and said they couldnt stop with withdrawals even though they have access to my account after I requested them to stop.\\nOn XX/XX/20 I called Chase Business Services to see if there was a way to get my payoff lowered or reduce my payments/interest rate. I was told that it would adversely affect my credit score if I settled on a payoff less then the amount owed. I then asked if there would be any additional charges if I just paid the card off and the answer was no. So on XX/XX/20 the card was paid in full. I then received a bill on XX/XX/20 for {$73.00} as an interest charge on {$0.00}. I called Chase business service about this and they responded that the interest is a month behind.

I asked if they did not have the statements, either to reprint them or just send me a list of all the unauthorized charges by the Law Firm. So far, since XX/XX/XXXX, have not received.

They told me thats not possible, even though my original card was not received within the time frame given. They also tried to downplay the situation, saying it can take longer than the time frame given. I patiently waited for them to deliver the new card, but finally decided to call in XX/XX/2020 to report that I still do not have the replacement card. I know they said that it can take longer than expected, but a month seems excessive. The representative then told me that he will expedite shipping for me ( originally not possible when I called a month before ). \\nXXXX attempted delivery today and said they couldnt get in my apartment complex. They said I can pick it up at a XXXX location. I requested to pick it up at a different location, but was told that Capital One placed a hold on that option, so I would have to request Capital One to lift the hold so I can pick it up at the location of my choice. I called Capital One and spoke to an agent who said that picking it up at another location would not be secured. I asked to speak with a supervisor, who made a conference call with XXXX. We were both told that the sender would need to lift the restrictions for me to pick up my card at a different XXXX location. XXXX ( Capital One supervisor ) told me that she will place me on hold and when she returned on the line, told me theres nothing that they can do about it because their agreement with XXXX is just to deliver it at the address sent. She was with me on the line when XXXX said that the sender needs to lift the restrictions. I clarified with her that what shes saying is that once the card is sent, they do not have anything to do with it anymore. She replied, yes. \\nIm not asking for my package to be sent to a new address. Just picked up at a different XXXX location. Their incompetence and unwillingness to assist me have made the situation much more frustrating.

They also cancelled my account number and issued me a new card with a new account number. \\n\\nExactly one month later on XX/XX/XXXX, the same charge appeared again!

After I got irate with her she transferred me to a \"\" specialist \\'\\' named XXXX. He said that the only way I could protect my account from fraudulent charges was to close it, and that there was no other way to stop it. This infuriated me further but I reluctantly agreed because I was already tired of dealing with Capital One and wanted the whole thing to go away. He said he closed my account and that the charge should fall off my account within 5 business days.\\n\\nWell imagine my surprise when 5 business days came and went with the charge still sitting on my account. I again called Capital One on XXXX and spoke with XXXX who promptly transferred me to a woman named XXXX that claimed to be a \"\" specialist \\'\\'. She then proceeded to tell me that because my account is closed they do not have to investigate fraudulent charges and that it is up to me to contact the person doing the fraud and somehow make them stop. She further added that even though my account was closed they had every right to continue allowing the charge to be charged every month and that they had every intention of doing exactly that. She was incredibly snide during the entire conversation. \\n\\nAs far as I\\'m concerned they purposely lied to get me to voluntarily close my account at which point they immediately washed their hands and said it\\'s all my problem now and they aren\\'t going to ever do anything to stop these charges which I\\'m sure are going to keep coming forever. \\n\\nWhat I want is the charge removed and the account permanently closed with a XXXX  balance with no ability for anyone to make further charges.

Copy of my statement since XXXX is attached. \\n\\nThank you,', 'Dear Sir or Madam : I received my XXXX statement and scheduled an on-line payment on XX/XX/XXXX as what I did in the past 16 years. However, I found the payment was not carried out when I viewed my XXXX statement. So I used the on-line message system to report this problem at XXXX on XXXX XXXX. I didn\\'t get any response. The credit card issuer stated some delay during the COVID19 pandemic. I contacted again at XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and waited for almost 40 minutes and left a lot of message including what the problem is and how i want it resolved, etc. At the same time, I scheduled the payment for the balance from my purchase and left the fees from the problems. I didn\\'t received any response specific on my request from the credit card issuer since XX/XX/XXXX. \\nThe XXXX statement keeps adding the fee to my account on the balance I am not responsible for. \\nI save all the message with the time from the on-line message system for this complaint in case of request. \\nAt the same time, I found that the issuer closed my second credit card. I looked through the statement and the issuer took my points of about {$35.00} in XX/XX/XXXX. The claimed that this card was not point earned within a year. however, the second credit card had an annual dividend so that the issuer can\\'t take my points. \\nI realized that the credit card issuer has made mistakes and take money from its customers. \\nThank you very much.\"\\nA company by the name of XXXX XXXX XXXX  charged my credit card in the amount of XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX and its been since then and no resolution.\\n\"This complaint is against Chase Credit Cards, a part of J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., doing business as Chase Bank. \\n\\nAs a Chase Sapphire Preferred credit card customer, I was subjected to a fraudulent charge of {$290.00} from merchant XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX based in XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX. Listed transaction date was XX/XX/2019 and transaction posted date was XX/XX/2019. Transaction reference number is XXXX. \\n\\nI filed a dispute for the full amount of {$290.00} on XX/XX/2019. Case number is XXXX. Somehow and without any sound reasoning, Chase opened a duplicate dispute for the same transaction and assigned in case number XXXX dated XX/XX/2019. \\n\\nThe original dispute stems from the fact that the merchant charged me twice for the same car rental, or they forged a second car rental contract and charged it to my Chase credit card, which was provided to them for incidentals only. \\n\\nThe original car rental reservation was prepaid by a different ( non-Chase ) credit card. Chase was provided documented evidence ( receipt and reservation confirmation ) of that rental from the very first dispute filing. \\n\\nI had only authorized my Chase credit card to the rental desk clerk for incidentals/damages on my prepaid rental. I never authorized any other charge on it. That evidence was completely ignored by Chase. \\n\\nFurthermore, I believe Chase gave the merchant more than the 30 days they said they provide to merchants for replying to disputes. I called Chase customer service close to the 30-day mark and was told by an agent that the dispute was ruled in my favor because the merchant never replied.\\n\\nThen around the 35-day mark Chase forwarded documents from the merchant showing fraudulent signatures that bore zero resemblance to my authentic signature. I contested the fraudulent signatures within the allotted time via paper mail, as well as via Chase \\'s internal online messaging system. I reiterated the fact that I had already provided proof of payment to merchant via another credit card. I asked why that was ignored. \\n\\nBoth, my letter, as well as my secure email message to Chase were completely ignored ( I have proof ). They re-billed the {$290.00} to my credit card account and back-dated it to XX/XX/2019. \\n\\nI\\'m confident that the facts and supporting evidence of this dispute will clearly demonstrate that Chase has committed unprofessional and unethical conduct. They are bullying a consumer who has been defrauded. I have excellent credit, and I take pride in fulfilling my financial obligations. However, I refuse to be defrauded and pushed around. I will hold steadfast to my principles by never paying a dime of that {$290.00}, and I kindly request a thorough investigation of Chase \\'s business practices pertaining their dispute process.\"\\nI have disputed this account and have reached out to the company/creditors MANY times but failed. This account is being reported inaccurately and incorrectly on my credit report.\\n\"I took advantage of a balance transfer offer with Barclay \\'s bank credit card. Shortly after requesting the transfer I noticed one of the receiving bank \\'s account number was wrong. I requested they stop or reverse the transaction, or make the transfer to the correct account number. It took a week to get someone on the phone to report the issue, although I used their \"\" secure message center \\'\\' that seems to provide only canned responses. They continually said it would be escalated to the correct department with a resolution, first in 1 week, then it would be 2 weeks, then it would be a month. After 2 weeks, though, they tried to close the complaint and said it could not be re-opened, but would have to file a new complaint. After following up, they advised the matter was closed! It then was re-opened only this time for yet another 30 days. Within this interim and after more than a month, Barclay \\'s agreed to temporarily credit the account during investigation. They were uncooperative and seemed to want to wash their hands of what they consider a completed transaction. After almost 3 months and no resolution, I contacted the Delaware Banking Commissioner ( DBC ). The result was Barclay \\'s  contact the other credit card bank to verify the transfer. Barclay \\'s was told by the receiving bank that the account number was \"\" a \\'\\' valid account, but did not verify it wasn\\'t mine ( so now someone else has had a transfer credit to their card with my funds ). The DBC shared with me their reply, provided me with the transaction numbers used for Barclay \\'s transfer to the other bank. I also was told that I should give this to the receiving bank so they can located the funds. Barclay \\'s again, washed their hands of the issue, posted the funds back to my account lowering my available credit, increasing what I owe and finance charges, and now reports to the credit bureau an incorrect usage of my card that has a negative affect to my credit score. Upon contacting the other bank, the other bank could not find any transaction of this amount on or about the respective dates, but they said they would look into it. Next, a series of requests from the other bank ( XXXX, where I have 3 accounts and best they verified was none of my accounts received the funds ) for more information from me including the erroneous account number that I do not have nor could obtain from Barclay \\'s, and proof of payment by Barclay \\'s that they won\\'t supply. I am at a loss. Further details with conversation logs are in my attachment. Over the years, I was licensed under various state Department of Financial Regulations and have never seen something so incompetent or treated with such disinterest and lack of customer service.', 'Sunday XX/XX/2020 called synchrony bank XXXX XXXX XXXX spoke with XXXX. \\nInformed XXXX that I no longer have income and would like the account closed with no interest or late fees accessed. Per XXXX the account is closed to purchases but no closed completely. Have asked could the account be closed with no interest or late fees included. Per XXXX the account will need to be sent to third party before that could happen. Informed XXXX I have no income at this time due to the pandemic virus. Per XXXX only late fees will be waived of XXXX but payment will be needed to be made. Informed XXXX due the circumstances I have no income.\"\\nA Consent Order ( File No. 2017 XXXX XXXX  ) was administered in XXXX and directly effected me and my family. A small monetary compensation was provided but I am still feeling the effects three years later, however it is correctable. The inaccurate credit reporting lead other creditors to lower credit limits, increase interest rates, decline mefor credit, etc. Therefore, even after the consent order was complete the effects are still impacting me. If I can step by step rebuild where I was before this catastrophic financial event. My request is to increase my credit limit to where it was prior to this which was {$7900.00}. Currently, it is {$6100.00}. This decreases the usage rate which impacts my credit score which makes me as creditworthy as I was before this error documented in the consent order took place.\\nNot sure if anything before this is right. I got a XXXX  preferred card from citi with an offer to transfer an interest loan to a no interest card for 20 months i knew doing this would lower my credit scores but it would bounce back in a couple months. That is when things went wrong I did the transfer in XX/XX/2020 and in XX/XX/XXXX they seen my score dropped so they lowered my limits on my double cash card from XXXX to XXXX causing that card to be maxed out then in XXXX they lowered my XXXX card from XXXX to XXXX so that was maxed out as well driven my score way down i have no missed or late payments on any of my accounts and did this transfer to free up more funds to pay them down faster now I pay more than what they ask almost 3 times the amount to make sure it\\'s paid before the twenty months is up i have called them 3 to 4 times this month and can not get them to stop lowering my limits or to put my limits back to where they were. by them lower my limits I have lost about 40 points on my credit score.\\n\"On XX/XX/2019 a charge for {$1700.00} appeared on my Chase credit card for a purchase that Chase reported as \"\" XXXX XXXX XXXX \\'\\'. I did not make or authorize this charge. Accordingly, I contacted Chase on XX/XX/XXXX or XXXX, immediately after I noticed this fraudulent charge on my account. \\n\\nChase \\'s response was to initially investigate the charge, and because I am in the process of buying a house, I went ahead and paid the charge just so it did not show a balance and potentially affect my credit rating while I was being underwritten for a home mortgage. \\n\\nChase then credited the charge back to me, and I thought that Chase had properly determined that the charge was fraudulent. However, when I called to have the money that I had paid be transferred to another credit card at Chase, Chase indicated that the charge was still under review and that the extra money I paid was stuck in my credit card account. \\n\\nThen on Friday, XX/XX/XXXX, Chase called me in the afternoon while I was at work, and told me that they had to debit the charge back to my account, because their research showed that I had used my Chase credit card with XXXX when I flew the airline last summer. I did in fact fly XXXX last summer, but I never authorized {$1700.00} charge that appeared on my account many months later, this past XXXX. Chase tried to tell me that this was a disputed charge and the issue was with me and XXXX. \\n\\nIn my conversations with Chase, as summarized above, Chase kept me on the phone for hours and kept bouncing me back and forth between their fraud department and their disputed payments department. I had to talk to one Chase \"\" investigator \\'\\' who was supposed to ask me some important questions. He asked me if I had a membership of any sort with XXXX or if I had authorized this charge. I reiterated no to both questions, as I had indicated many times to many people with whom I spoke at Chase. He then tried to call XXXX to ask them about the charge, and after keeping me on hold 15 or 20 minutes, he got back on the phone with me and said that XXXX unfortunately couldn\\'t be reached. He never volunteered to have Chase call XXXX during normal business hours. He basically just tried to kick the liability back to me. \\n\\nFinally, on Friday afternoon, another Chase agent said she was submitting my \"\" case \\'\\' to the \"\" rebill \\'\\' department because Chase would have to further \"\" investigate \\'\\' and potentially \"\" rebill \\'\\' the transaction. The agent said this might take 30 days. \\n\\nThe whole handling of this case amounts to Chase trying to concoct a reason to get off the hook for a fraud charge, for which Chase is clearly liable. I never bought an upgrade for XXXX this past XXXX and somehow someone else used my card number to do so. Chase is trying to say that this is some sort of a special circumstance because I used my credit card with XXXX last summer ; but the fact of the matter is Chase can\\'t prove where the person who made the charge ended up getting my number. For instance, that fraudster could have been a restaurant where I used the card. Or it could have been some online source. For Chase to try to categorize this as a dispute and run me through the ringer on a major fraud charge is terrible. \\n\\nNow it is Sunday XXXX on XX/XX/2019 at XXXX XXXX ET and I just got off the phone with a Chase representative. This representative reconfirmed the above, which is that Chase refuses to call this charge a fraudulent charge. The Chase agent called it a disputed charge. This is criminal mis-categorization of a charge that was clearly fraudulent because I DID NOT MAKE THIS CHARGE. Chase is absolutely stepping on the consumer and trying to weasel out of its obligation. \\n\\nMoreover, this is clearly a policy and process at Chase, which means that it is being repeated over and over again, trying to weasel innocent consumers out of a cumulative of millions of dollars. I recommend a full scale investigation and the imposition of significant fines for this practice, similar to what was leveled on Chase for its many mortgage transgressions over the last decade. \\n\\nI have spent countless hours on the phone trying to resolve this with Chase and now I have had to spend more time summarizing this egregious episode with CFPB. Chase should be liable for compensating me for the time that I have had to spend to get my money back.', 'Hi I called to close my first progress credit card account XXXX after depositing XXXX USD cash a few years ago.

On XX/XX/XXXX I went online to pay my bill and the website was having issues. I tried call them on a few occasions to pay my bill and was told to call back because the high amount of calls received. Due to the COVID 19 pandemic we are told to stay home, and Best Buy was not allowing people in there store. At that time I only owe {$1.00} to Best for my card payment but I was unable to get my payment to them. I finally go through but it was pass the due date. My credit limit was {$4000.00} and was drop to {$500.00}, which has cause my credit score to drop. Best Buy was able to update date my payment and remove late fees, but when I reached out to Citibank ( Best Buy ) to instate my credit to XXXX, they said I should have made a better attempt to pay and that they can\\'t do nothing to restate my previous credit limit.\\n\"I received a letter from from First Bankcard C/O First National Bank of Omaha stating that they had decreased the credit limit on my account DURING the National COVID-19 Pandemic. The change was made prior to any communication or notice period to me. The change has negatively impacted my credit score which in turn could potentially create undue financial hardship. As a consumer, I am appalled that while other financial organizations are trying to help consumers - First Bankcard is harming its consumers. \\n\\nThe letter stated that they pulled my credit report. They did not have permission to do so. The account has been paid as agreed since it was opened. Never one late payment. The account has been paid off 2-3 times during the same timeframe. All payments have been above the minimum payment. \\n\\nI believe they limited my credit line because I was not utilizing the credit. Now - because they decreased the credit line to the exact, current balance - it shows as if I am maxed out on the account when it fact, they manufactured this result.\"\\nDiscover closed my good standing credit card account that was opened back in 2000 without my knowledge and for no reason\\n\"We spoke to a phone representative from XXXX XXXX  which is a financial representative of XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX the bill was due on XX/XX/XXXX We asked to pay the balance in full for approximately {$100.00}. \\nA week later we were assessed a service fee of approximately {$40.00} as balance was not pain the XXXX and then they charged approximately another {$40.00} service fee on the service fee.\"\\nI paid off my Discover Card balance and requested a credit increase. I was transferred to three different people all who said they would submit the request and I would have a response in 30 seconds. The first person said there would not be a hard hit on my credit report, but then said I needed to talk to another group. The second person said there would be a hard hit on my credit report. The second person continued but then they transferred me to a third person. The third person said there would be yet another hard hit on my credit report for the increase. At this point I told Discover staff I simply did not believe what they were saying. I did not get a credit increase and I was told there was now a hard hit on my credit report.\\n\"We have been a Discover Card holder for over 10 years.

I took it just for emergencies, it stays in my glove box. I always use my visa from my credit union and pay the full balance every month. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a XXXX or XXXX XXXX letter delivered to my home. It was a Citi letter saying my account was past due. I immediately called for details. I was told XXXX had automatically charged my membership renewal to the Citi card. I explained that I did not authorize the charge and had received no statements, emails or calls. The representative suggested I pay the balance and he would file a dispute to refund the charges. I gave him my checking account routing and account number. {$240.00} went to Citi from my account ( statement attached ) On XX/XX/XXXX I realized a credit had no been received, so I logged onto the Citi account to check status. Not only was there no credit, the membership renewal was charged again, with interest and late charges. I contacted XXXX to complain and they referred my complaint to Citi. They say they lost my payment. The representative XXXX asked I send the statement copy. She later called and said she had listened to the call where I made the payment and was sure it had gone thru, but I needed to get more details from my bank, which I sent to her XX/XX/XXXX. On hearing nothing back, I asked on XX/XX/XXXX via email for status. I get a call back saying they had found the payment, and credited charges. I asked if she was going to contact the credit bureaus as this had lowered my score from its normal A to C ( copy attached ). She said that they would not.

That was greater than what I initially suspected to be the issue, however I trusted the word of the mechanic as when we was explaining to me some of the symptoms I was most likely experiencing they all echoed what I had previously described to him. I provided them the green-light to move forward with the repairs as this was my primary means of transportation and had no options. \\n\\nThe work was completed on XX/XX/XXXX and I picked up my vehicle up on that date as quickly as I received the phone call as I was borrowing a co-workers car.

After a few more days, I received a call to pick up the car, surprising the same issues were still very apparent. When speaking to them, they agreed I would still experience the same issues and that I would need to drive it for a few days and the issues would resolve on their own, not completely agreeing with that approach, I decided to do just that. \\n\\nAfter a week of continuous contact with the shop, I took some time off of work to take the car back to the shop. At this point, they stated that the transmission went bad and needed to be replaced, to say the least I was shock but again limited with options. I told them that I understand that things like these are out of their control at times but to try to help me resolve this so that I didnt have to take any additional days off from work. They told me to continue to drive the car as there would not be any harm and they would order a new transmission and call me in a few days once it arrives. I never heard back from the shop and after multiple attempts to call and speak to the mechanic were unsuccessful, I decided to drive up there. Upon arrival I asked to speak to the mechanic, and although I could see him in the shop, was told he was unavailable, so I asked to speak with another mechanic or the shop manager to get a status on my transmission and was told that no one was available and that there was nothing more they could do for me at their shop and in short asked to leave. \\n\\nI was shocked and sat in my car for a little while trying to understand why someone would do such a thing and take advantage of someone in this manner. I gathered all my information and shared it with the team at Discover and opened a dispute. Discover advised me that I had signed the receipt acknowledging for the work to be done, that is correct, however my signature was for the serviced to be performed as decided, for which they were not. \\n\\nI took it upon myself to take my vehicle to another shop and they deemed that the transmission was truly bad, however that it had NEVER been replaced. They provided me with documentation to support their findings and I provided that to Discover to support my dispute.

JPM Chase approved the charge without checking with me. \\n\\nXX/XX/2021 : I saw the charge on my card after receiving a credit downgrade alert from a credit reporting agency. I called JPM Chase immediately and the said they would reverse the charge. JPM Chase suggested we call the car rental company. Despite the fact that the rental car company told us they would not charge the card without informing us first, they said they would not reverse the charge as it had already been approved. \\n\\nXX/XX/2021 : The charge had not yet been reversed so I called JPM Chase again. They bounced me around between customer service and disputes for 30 minutes. They finally told me they would not be reversing the charge for 15 days.

The decline made by Citibank on XX/XX/XXXX failed to show that they performed a substantial investigation and their conclusion was based on stale and inaccurate information from the merchant in XX/XX/XXXX. Citibank stated that the information I provided was not substantial documents. I provided the actual screen shots of the online chat with the airline representative to show that the tickets were not valid. I also documented the conversation I had with the airline representatives that the tickets were canceled by the merchant. If Citibank had truly performed the investigation, they would have found out that the merchant had gotten my refund from the airline since XX/XX/XXXX and that the airline would not provide substantial documents to the customers since the reservation was made via a travel agent. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/2020XXXX, I spoke with XXXX XXXX representative, XXXX , regarding XXXX order, the representative confirmed that the refund was provided to the XXXX parent company, XXXX XXXX XXXX , on XX/XX/XXXX. This was the date that Citibank closed the case and debited my account. I emailed my refund requests to XXXX customer service numerous times, there was no response. On XX/XX/XXXX, the Communications Director, XXXX XXXX from XXXX responded to my email after I sent the request to the merchants CEO. Mr. XXXX denied of receiving the refund from the airline and provided inaccurate information stating that XXXX airline had told them that they were not able to apply a full refund and I have to proof that the airline would promise a full refund. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from the airline verifying that the refund for my reservation has provided to the travel agent. I provided the email proof to the travel agents CEO and Mr. XXXX, there was no response. The travel agent did not deliver the service to me on XX/XX/XXXX and took my money. \\nI did make a flight reservation with the merchant, XXXX XXXX and I did receive the confirmation 8 days after placing the order. However, the service was supposed to deliver on XX/XX/XXXX did not deliver by the merchant. My departure date for this reservation was XX/XX/XXXX. The merchant unilaterally canceled my flight reservation on XX/XX/XXXX, some hour before my departure date. I provided the screen shots of the airline chat records to show that the tickets were not valid on my departure date, XX/XX/XXXX ( # 5 ). How did I get service from XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX when they purposely canceled my flight tickets on XX/XX/XXXX? I performed the agents job to gather evidence from the airline to proof that both Citibank and the travel agent did not perform its due diligence. \\nI understand Citibank wants to make fees out of this transaction by ignoring consumers rights. Based on Citibanks imprudent and irresponsible conclusion, I do not feel that I am protected under the Fair Credit Billing Act from unfair credit billing practices. I was charged for \"\" goods or services not received. While the airline has provided my refund to the travel agent, they failed to properly reflect payments or credits to my account, instead they stated that the airline did not told them to refund me ; and the merchant failed to provide written proof from the airline that a refund for the inquired reservation is not possible. With all the proof, Citibank still think the merchant entitles to the payment even though they did not provide me service. Citibank should provide training to its staff on how to investigate and analyze the dispute. \\nFurther, Citibank never accepted my complaint as a billing error. There was no record showing that such dispute was entered into my account. However, my clean account was reported to the credit agencies as past due. It was not my misunderstanding of Citibanks negligence. Citibank failed to investigate my account by imprudently put in a robotic and standard language to defame my good standing account. \\n\\nI dont know what kind of document is considered substantial to Citibank? All I know is that Citibank did not do its job. If Citibank wants to verify whether the facts provide by the customer are substantial, they should contact to the airline to verify the information instead of relying solely on the merchants outdated and invalid information. The merchant still show that the tickets are open in their internal system ( # 6 ). This is the merchants system, they can leave the ticket status :  open, canceled or closed. The airlines system has the final say. The airline is the one to collect the money and provide the refund. The tickets were booked via the travel agent ; hence, only the travel agent can request document from the airline. Citibank is well aware of the US travel agent rules, but they refuse to recognize the merchants fault or perform an investigation by victimized its customer.\"\\nOn XX/XX/2019, I returned merchandise to Macys that was originally purchased with a Visa. Despite using a different credit card, Macys posted the returns to my Macys credit card. This resulted in over {$1200.00} in excess monies posted to my Macys account. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called their customer service dept to request a refund check. I was told that if I provided my bank account number it would be faster and would only take 3-5 business days. I called again on XX/XX/XXXX, and was told it would be deposited on XX/XX/XXXX. I expressed that I was leaving out of the country and needed that deposit for my mortgage. Upon my return, I saw that there was no deposit. I called on XX/XX/XXXX and was told that the refund was not approved and they would process the deposit in 20 days. After speaking to a supervisor, I was told a deposit would be made that week. I called again on XX/XX/XXXX and was told a CHECK was mailed on XX/XX/XXXX. As of today, XX/XX/XXXX, I have not received my money. This has caused my XXXX mortgage to be late and now XXXX. I am currently unemployed and looking for a job in accounting. My credit report is always taken into consideration during the application and background check. Macys unscrupulous and unethical practices are causing me financial hardship, stress, credit reporting concerns with my mortgage and other bills, and risk of not passing my background check for employment. Macys is very quick to post charges to my credit cards and issue late fees for late payments but is holding my money and continues to lie to me.\\n\"I believe I received an EIP debit card in a white envelope and put it in the trash as junk mail. The IRS website stated that the payment was sent out the week of XX/XX/2020. But we ( my wife and I ) have not received any payment from the government but may have received, as I recall, a unsolicited envelope from Money Network. Money Network would not reissue or replace the lost Economic Impact Payment ( EIP ) debit card or advise whether the card was issued without providing a social security number even though we had to provide a portion of the SS # to gain access to a representative ; they insisted on the full social security number for identification purposes or to even look up information. This practice is in violation of FTC \\'s instructions, as well a federal law, on its secure website that specifically states \"\" Dont give them your Social Security or debit card number, or any other information. Then report it to the FTC at ftc.gov/complaint which I did. I am reporting the company for violation of scamming, attempting to scam, requiring a social security number as a form of identification and as a scam intended to steal money issued under the stimulus payment Economic Impact Payment program. We are unable to obtain any information regard the EIP payment or debit card. We are unable to collect the stimulus money issued to us because of the corrupt practices of the company. I am unable to assess whether the card was issued, the status of the card or any other information other than the IRS website stating the the money was sent XX/XX/2020. This appears to be an attempt to retain money issued under the EIP program by the company. The amount involved is the reported {$2400.00} that would have been issued under the EIP program. Without addressing this issue the potential is {$100.00} \\'s of millions or more will be lost by people unable to obtain and unknowingly lose their EIP payments as a result of this company and the failure of the government to adequately inform people that they were issuing EIP payment by a third party and to be aware of this issue.\"\\nIve had a credit card with XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX  for about seven years.

During the 6 weeks I spent sending emails, phone calls asking for my hotel voucher that I never received. I explained to them that I called the resort and they have no bookings under my name I called them numerous of times booking place in XXXX and hotel resort in XXXX. I spent nearly 6 weeks begging for my hotel voucher after much frustration I called XXXX and cancelled the vacation. I then proceeded to use a local travel agent to rebook my trip. I then called XXXX XXXX and they explained because my name wasnt on the booking that these flight could be cancelled at anytime. I was advised to not risk it. I then called my creditor Capital One to report fraud that This company took my money booked my airline tickets I was able to confirm but did not book my hotel I was never able to confirm no booking listed at resort. I explained everything to them and capital one advised me they would take care of the fraud and to rebook my trip because it was going to be a 90 day dispute, and if I hadnt rebooked I would have missed my vacation. Capital one also advised me that to make a resolution with them to contact them at the email that was provided to them which I did make several attempts to no one ever responding. I recently talked with capital one and was told that capital one has continued to try and contact this company for over a year now and they cant get anyone to respond either. The capital one service representative stated to me it looks like fraud since no response has been successful. I said I know they never once have responded to any of my emails, and every phone call is their English was terrible so when I called to cancel maybe they didnt understand the word cancel in English. I asked capital one to please provide me a hotel voucher because its a required paper when checking into these hotels and one was  never provided. The hotel voucher would be issued from the hotel resort confirming I had rooms there. The whole reason for this dispute is because I wasnt flying 1200 miles without this voucher thats required at check-in. I tried numerous times from booking company to please obtain it and send it. My hotel was never booked. I rebooked after fighting for 6 weeks through a local travel agent and received my voucher within 2 days at the hotel resort as previously requested.

They then canceled my card because I missed 2 payments ( which is simply not the case ). I was told to reapply if I wish to have credit and that they would not reinstate my card. I find this to be absolutely ridiculous because I attempted to make the payment on more than one occasion.\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I purchased a Bluebird American Express prepaid debit card. The cost was {$5.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX I tried to register my card online and what should have only taken 5 minutes ended up being close to an hour with no resolve. I entered the address where I wanted my card to be sent. The system stated that it did not recognize it as a U.S. postal service address. It was a U.S. Postal Service ( physical ) address that was registered for both business and personal use. I then used a home address that was also listed with the U.S. Postal Service. The system recognized the address but continued to delete the other information I had previously entered requiring me to enter it again and again. Everytime I entered the correct, necessary information and clicked the submit button, I would have to repeat the process over again. I made numerous attempts to register my card. It was extremely frustrating, not to mention the fact that there was no live customer service representative to help. I searched online and found the American Express credit card phone number. After going through several prompts I was finally able to speak to a representative about their card. Her name was XXXX. She took my card information and then gave me the run around. I told her that she was not very helpful as she never answered if customers were able to speak to a live representative through the Bluebird number listed on the card. I told her there was no way that I could speak to a live representative and that the automated system kept giving me the run around. When I asked if customer service was ever available at Bluebird she said that I would have to contact them to ask. How can I ask customer service if there was no way to connect with them through the automated system? When I explained that I could not get a hold of anyone she just kept repeating that I would have to contact them to ask. Being that I was unable to get any help from American Express, I went back online and tried to register again for about the 10th time. At that time a message stated, in so many words, that American Express was not able to offer me an account. I was hurt after spending my own money to purchase the card. I was unable to Register for no apparent reason. I was upset about the length of the process and the fact that I was given the run around. I completely expected more professionalism from a company like American Express.\\n\"Hi, I was an authorized user on my brother Capital One Savor credit card account.

When I received that statement it showed a fee of {$5.00}, but also a Cash Advance balance, subject to interest rate of {$16.00} and Interest Charge of {$0.00}. This was not explained to me before the transaction. I was told the charge to cash Advance was a mistake, and would be removed. The following month it was still on my statement.

After calling Best Buy directly several times with no resolution, I tried to dispute this 21st charge on XX/XX/XXXX through Citi. They gave me a resolution on XX/XX/XXXX pointing to the credit on the XXXX. I called a few times and was told that this would be taken care of but it never was. \\n\\nFinally I got someone who seemed to understand what had happened here and she tried to reopen the original dispute but couldn\\'t.

This year I called back now approximately five times to settle the account again since I was never contacted like they stated I would be and was given the same run around. Only this time I was advised on four separate occasions that the account would be escalated to senior management so that the account can be brought back to the original bank so I can settle my account. It has been over a month and I have called at least once every week to follow up after being told after each conversation that in a week or two the account should have been recovered back to their bank. I have made several attempts to settle this account with no success as Barclays Financing has not assisted nor accepted my payments.

He wrote a letter demanding a response within 15 days. Nothing was ever received. Our attorney recently gave us information on how to get in contact with CFPB to help with this matter. We canceled the credit card last fall and will never use Discover card again. We pay all our balances monthly and never carried a balance with Discover card. They refused to see that we are not the kind of people who do not pay their bills or look at our 20-year history with Discover card. And they are ruining our credit score.\\n\"At around XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, I was going to bed when I received the alert on my cellular phone, saying {$120.00} was charged on my American Express card at the XXXX near my house. It was still pending, but I called Amex right away to report the fraud. After investigation, I realized the credit card with the renewed expiration date was on the way, and was supposed to arrive on XX/XX/XXXX, which I did not receive as well as one of the utility bills. \\n\\nAfter the card was used at XXXX, it was declined at several places ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX  ) on the next couple of days. Filed the police report also. \\n\\nIn a week or so after filing the claim, I got the credit to my account. Thought this case was closed. However, at the end of XXXX, I noticed the amount was re-billed to my account. I contacted Amex again a few days later to ask why, but didn\\'t get an answer to it. Instead, the person said he would open a brand new claim to take care of it. Close to the end of XXXX, I found this charge was included to the total balance. On XX/XX/XXXX, my boyfriend and I called Amex, and got to talk to XXXX with the Fraud Prevention Team. She looked at the record of my account and said it was not right. It seemed the people I had talked to before treated this case as a dispute, not as a fraud. She was trying to open a new fraud claim against the amount re-billed, but couldn\\'t. So she told me she would take care of it and call me the following day. \\n\\nAs of XX/XX/XXXX, the claim XXXX opened ( # XXXX ) is still open and the fraudulent charge is included to the statement balance. I have been getting the reminder of payment, even though this fraudulent charge should not be a part of statement balance. \\n\\nI have been asking for the answers to the questions below since the fraud happened. But no one answered me so far. 1 ) Why could the new card be used without being activated by me? 2 ) Why did American Express send such a card to me by regular mail? 3 ) The first claim went through so quickly, then why is it taking so long to close the whole thing? 4 ) What did American Express do between the time I contacted about the re-billing and XX/XX/XXXX? It looks to me nothing happened. \\n\\nThe whole thing looks American Express wants me to give up and pay. They don\\'t live up to their promise of 100 % fraud protection. I would like them to process the claim as quickly as possible, and give me the answers to the four questions above.', 'American Express wont give my my negative balance back ( need for rent and for other card debt ). They told me that they can wire it to me once the balance is below XXXX. It would be quicker than mailing a check. I said great. \\nThen it became 3-5 business days.After memorial day, i check back, they are now saying 12-15 business days. \\nI will have to choose between missing a credit card payment, or skipping rent. \\nThis is not morally right. \\nWire transfers are almost instant. \\nThis seemed at first an AP days stretch of 3-5 business days.\\n\\nNow its 12-15 ... and im going to default from this \\'anomaly \\' Card ends in XXXX ( amex magnet )\"\\nI have a {$35.00} charge on my bill that does not belong. I have tried reaching the merchant but they are unable to assist and was told to contact my bank. I\\'ve been trying to reach someone at Barclay \\'s for the past few days. I have spent more than 2+ hours on hold only to be hung up on. They\\'re online chat/messaging is useless and only provides canned responses. Their online dispute portal gives an error, etc. Barclay \\'s has made it impossible to reach anyone at their customer support. They have messages blaming Covid, but here we are 4+ months into it and they haven\\'t gotten it together yet. I find this unacceptable and an atrocious business practice. A XXXX search for \\'barclays \\' returns many many others experiencing the exact same thing as myself. I would like this complaint to also document that I have been attempting to resolve a billing dispute. I don\\'t want Barclay \\'s to pull something saying that it was not submitted in a timely manner.\\n\"In summary, this narrative concerns Wells Fargo \\'s payment allocation practices on a personal credit card with multiple promotional rate balances with identical terms that expire at different times. Wells Fargo distributes payments among all of the balances in a manner deliberately engineered to make it impossible to pay off the balance expiring the soonest prior to expiration without also paying off the entire account in full. In addition, several payments were egregiously applied primarily to the newest balance ( i.e. the last to expire ). \\n\\nClearly this is designed to maximize Wells Fargo \\'s opportunity to generate income on transactions of this nature. When a consumer is forced to pay the total account balance to avoid interest charges on one balance expiring sooner than others, it also effectively revokes the duration of the promotional period promised for each transaction posting to the account after the initial one. These payment allocation practices were not described in any disclosures, on the credit access devices ( \"\" Superchecks \\'\\' ), on the statements, or in the terms and conditions of the account. Although there is presently no law in place to govern how payments are allocated when all balances on a credit card account are at the same interest rate, Wells Fargo is not in line with its peers ( the other three \"\" Big Banks \\'\\' ), which apply payments to multiple same-rate balances either in the order they post to an account or the order in which they expire. \\n\\nIn detail, I conducted a total of five transactions with identical terms ( 15 months at 0 % with a 4 % transaction fee ) for varying dollar amounts on separate occasions. No other transactions have taken place on the account aside from fourteen timely payments totaling {$2300.00} ( as of XX/XX/XXXX ). It was when I made this XX/XX/XXXX payment that I discovered how payments had been applied to the account. \\n\\nHere is the complete chronological breakdown per the figures shown on each statement. Payment # 4 shows nothing going to the newest balance, but payment # s 5, 6, and 7 demonstrate where most of the payment is nefariously applied to the newest balance. \\n\\nBalance # 1 - XX/XX/XXXX for {$4100.00}, expiring XX/XX/XXXX Balance # 2 - XX/XX/XXXX for {$1000.00}, expiring XX/XX/XXXX Payment # 1 -  XX/XX/XXXX for {$350.00} : {$280.00} to balance # 1, {$70.00} to balance # 2 Payment # 2 - XX/XX/XXXX for {$170.00} and Payment # 3 - XX/XX/XXXX for {$170.00} ( same billing cycle ) : {$280.00} to balance # 1, {$70.00} to balance # 2 Balance # 3 - XX/XX/XXXX for {$1500.00}, expiring XX/XX/XXXX Payment # 4 - XX/XX/XXXX for {$360.00} : {$280.00} to balance # 1, {$72.00} to balance # 2, {$0.00} to balance # 3 Payment # 5 - XX/XX/XXXX for {$100.00} : {$23.00} to balance # 1, {$5.00} to balance # 2, {$70.00} to balance # 3 Balance # 4 - XX/XX/XXXX for {$1500.00}, expiring XX/XX/XXXX Payment # 6 - XX/XX/XXXX for {$200.00} : {$64.00} to balance # 1, {$16.00} to balance # 2, {$29.00} to balance # 3, {$89.00} to balance # 4 Balance # 5 - XX/XX/XXXX for {$2000.00}, expiring XX/XX/XXXX Payment # 7, XX/XX/XXXX for {$200.00} : {$43.00} to balance # 1, {$10.00} to balance # 2, {$19.00} to balance # 3, {$19.00} to balance # 4, {$100.00} to balance # 5 Payment # 8, XXXX for {$140.00} : {$50.00} to balance # 1, {$12.00} to balance # 2, {$22.00} to balance # 3, {$22.00} to balance # 4, {$31.00} to balance # 5 Payment # 9, XX/XX/XXXX for {$100.00} : {$35.00} to balance # 1,  {$9.00} to balance # 2, {$16.00} to balance # 3, {$16.00} to balance # 4, {$22.00} to balance # 5 Payment # 10, XX/XX/XXXX for {$100.00} : {$35.00} to balance # 1, {$9.00} to balance # 2, {$16.00} to balance # 3, {$16.00} to balance # 4, {$22.00} to balance # 5 Payment # 11, XX/XX/XXXX for {$100.00} : {$35.00} to balance # 1, {$9.00} to balance # 2, {$16.00} to balance # 3, {$16.00} to balance # 4, {$22.00} to balance # 5 Payment # 12, XX/XX/XXXX for {$100.00} : {$35.00} to balance # 1, {$9.00} to balance # 2, {$16.00} to balance # 3, {$16.00} to balance # 4, {$22.00} to balance # 5 Payment # 13, XX/XX/XXXX for {$100.00} : {$35.00} to balance # 1, {$9.00} to balance # 2, {$16.00} to balance # 3, {$16.00} to balance # 4, {$22.00} to balance # 5 Payment # 14, XX/XX/XXXX for {$100.00} : {$35.00} to balance # 1, {$9.00} to balance # 2, {$16.00} to balance # 3, {$16.00} to balance # 4, {$22.00} to balance # 5 Payment # 15, XX/XX/XXXX for {$100.00} : To be determined on XX/XX/XXXX statement As of the XX/XX/XXXX statement, only {$1200.00} ( or 54.17 % of all payments ) has been applied to balance # 1, bringing it from {$4100.00} to {$2900.00}. Had payments been allocated as I anticipated, balance # 1 would instead be {$1800.00}, and the other balances would remain at their original dollar amounts. \\n\\nAfter reviewing all statements, Wells Fargo \\'s website, and 12 CFR Part 1026 ( Regulation Z ), 1026.53 Allocation of payments, I contacted Wells Fargo by phone on XX/XX/XXXX to determine 1 ) whether they accept requests to allocate payments in a specific way, 2 ) whether there is a written policy in place governing how payments are allocated when there are multiple balances at the same interest rate, and 3 ) whether a research request could be submitted to retroactively reallocate previously posted payments. \\n\\nI spoke with three Wells Fargo associates and was able to determine only that Wells Fargo does not accept requests for specific methods of payment allocation. The first associate offered the solution of waiting until the day after the promotion expired to make a payment, invoking the CARD act \\'s payment order rules regarding balances at different interest rates. This action would still allow any remaining balance to be subject to interest. It also does not address that the remaining balance would be higher than anticipated due to the allocation method. The third associate, in the \"\" executive office, \\'\\' was not able to locate a policy regarding payment allocation for multiple balances at the same interest rate and could not confirm whether payments could be reallocated. I specified to this associate that had I been aware of how payments would be allocated and, with no option to modify this, I would choose to conduct only one transaction. I informed this associate that I would be submitting the case to the CFPB. The associate provided a phone number and case number and advised that I would be contacted at a future date. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I called requesting a status update on my case. The associate advised that it could take \"\" up to a month \\'\\' for a response. As of this submission on XX/XX/XXXX - over five weeks since my initial contact - I have not received a response, and there are just over four weeks remaining until the first balance is set to expire. \\n\\nIn the meantime, I conducted additional research and was able to locate numerous other posted CFPB complaints from consumers who faced the same/similar issue with Wells Fargo ( the complaint numbers are : XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX, perhaps among others ), and also located a potentially relevant description of payment allocation on Wells Fargo \\'s website. \\n\\nThe description, located at https : //retailservices.wellsfargo.com/customer/faqs.html, states : \"\" Your payment applies first to the minimum payment due ( including past due amounts ) for that billing cycle. Anything over the minimum payment due generally applies first to No Interest if Paid in Full ( deferred interest ) promotions in the last two billing cycles before the expiration date of the promotion ( when applicable ) ; then to regular term balances with the highest APR to the lowest APR ; and then to all other sub-accounts based on expiration date. If you\\'d like to know how payments apply to your specific account, call us at XXXX, Monday - Friday, XXXX XXXX  to XXXX XXXX Central Time. \\'\\' It is unclear whether this policy applies only to Wells Fargo \\'s co-branded retail cards and does not define the term \"\" sub-account. \\'\\' It does indicate in this instance that payments can be applied \"\" based on the expiration date. \\'\\' However, it also implies that \"\" your specific account \\'\\' may have an entirely different set of payment allocation parameters than another. But lastly and perhaps most importantly, it provides that a consumer is able to determine how payments apply to a specific account. Wells Fargo was thus far unable to do this, aside from reiterating the basic provisions of the CARD act.\\n\\nWells Fargo may currently be in compliance with the law, but the payment allocation practices described in detail here are, I feel objectively, both abusive and deceptive to consumers. At a minimum, Wells Fargo should be able to explain their methodology when asked ( per  their own language quoted above ). At a minimum, the CFPB should require notification that payments can be applied in no or any particular fashion when there are only multiple same-rate balances on a credit card account. \\n\\nA secondary, unrelated issue also became apparent while poring over my account. To my knowledge, this did not impact me directly, and I did not bring it to Wells Fargo \\'s attention, but I believe this should be made known. Several of my statements were not consistent with the Minimum Payment calculation as specified in the account agreement : \"\" Minimum Payment. Your Minimum Payment Due includes any amount past due plus the greater of : - The sum of late, returned check, returned payment, rush plastic, and annual fees and interest billed during the Billing Cycle for which the Minimum Payment is calculated plus 1 % of the New Balance shown on the billing statement ; or - {$25.00} ( or the entire balance on the Account if the New Balance is less than {$25.00} ). \\'\\' Examples : - the minimum due for XX/XX/XXXX, on a 0 % balance of {$5200.00}, was {$250.00}. \\n- the minimum due for XX/XX/XXXX, on a 0 % balance of {$4800.00}, was {$97.00}. \\n- the minimum due for XX/XX/XXXX, on a 0 % balance of {$4500.00}, was {$90.00}. \\n\\nThe minimum due for XX/XX/XXXX appears to be 1 % of the balance plus the dollar amount of the transaction fees associated with the first two balance transfers ( {$160.00} and {$40.00} ). These fees are included in the 0 % interest balance and should not have been included in the minimum due. Subsequent transaction fees were not included in the minimum due following the closing of those statement cycles ( for example, the XX/XX/XXXX balance transfer of {$2000.00} had a transaction fee of {$80.00}, which was not added to the minimum due for XX/XX/XXXX ). Then, the minimums due for XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX represent 2 % of the balance rather than 1 %. It is not apparent why these three billing cycles required higher minimums due, when all following statements to present day are in alignment with the posted formula.', 'Initiated a balance transfer from another account to Wells Fargo and made timely payments during the promotional period. 15 days before the expiration of the promotional period I called in to pay 100 % of the balance off before the promotional period expires and interest is charged. Three levels of customer service confirmed with me that I could not pay off a specific promotional balance because their system did not allow for payments to be applied to specific promotional balances ( I had two ). Further, I was repeatedly told that though my statements say the promotional interest rate expires on XX/XX/2020, it didn\\'t really expire until the end of the billing cycle, or XX/XX/2020. I was told this is actually how Wells Fargo does this, but yet, I had nothing in writing to back up their statements. I was told to call in after the close of the billing cycle and as assured on the phone I would not be charged interest until after the close of the billing cycle. Three issues : 1. Zero ability to pay off the promotional balance separately, and, 2. I had zero documentation reported to me on how my payments would be applied, because my thought is they would be applied to the balance expiring first, and, 3. I had zero documentation reported to me on their purported actual date the promotional  interest rate actually expires. \\n\\nI want to pay what I owe and have it paid before I am charged interest, yet, this does not seem possible.\"\\nAmerican Express serve card just cut off a bunch of customers accounts.

I later logged into my Capital One account and found that indeed I was charged for the transaction. \\n\\nI contacted Capital One to investigate. Capital One did credit me back that {$1700.00} transaction and a couple other fraudulent ones. Shortly thereafter, they reversed the debits to my account, closed the account and stated that they looked into the matter with the XXXX  ( the vendor ) and concluded there was nothing wrong. I was never given proof of the transaction ( s ) ever occurring or proof of the cash being given to me, just a statement that they did investigate. To this day, I have made substantial payments to Capital One to keep my credit rating, but I feel that I am being taken advantage of, been abused and unfairly treated. I am a single consumer against two very large financial institutions. If I didn\\'t get the cash advance, who did? Someone within either organization? Was this angle ever investigated? Why was no proof ever given to me?', 'This letter details a complaint against the Home Depot Credit Services ( Citibank ). On XX/XX/2019 I paid a balance of {$280.00} that was due on my Home Depot Credit card account via check. My financial institution ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) showed that the check had been cashed on XX/XX/2019 and funds in that amount had been withdrawn. \\n\\nHowever, the next month I received a statement from HD Credit Services indicating that the payment had not been received and that I owed the {$280.00} plus interest and a late fee. I immediately contacted them to dispute the claim and was told that they had not received the check and that I needed to provide proof of such. On XX/XX/19 I went to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX  ) and obtained the requested documentation and both faxed and mailed it to HD Credit Services to the attention of the Payment Research Department. After several calls to verify that they had received the information, I spoke with XXXX on XX/XX/19 who stated that they had received the faxed documentation and it would take 7-10 days to review it. \\n\\nYet again I received another bill with a late fee added and was informed that the investigation into our dispute was being closed by HD Credit Services due to insufficient proof that the check was received. The issue seemed to have been that the back of the check was not stamped or endorsed. Therefore, on XX/XX/19 I meet with a Financial Services Representative at XXXX. He was able to obtain a copy of the source of receipt which proved that the money was taken out of the Federal Reserve on XX/XX/19.  On this same date I spoke with XXXX from the Payment Applied Department at HD Credit Services. He stated that there was no email where I could forward this information, but I could mail or fax it. This was done on XX/XX/19. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/19 I received a letter from HD Credit Services dated XX/XX/19 stating that I should call them at my earliest convenience. I spoke with XXXX and then XXXX on XX/XX/19 and was informed that I needed to obtain a proof of payee and that I could dispute the issue with my bank or with the bank who cashed that check. The source of receipt was insufficient because it did not show that the funds were deposited with CBNA/THD. When I asked XXXX to send me something in writing explaining exactly what information I needed, XXXX stated that he couldnt do that. Only form letters were sent out because their company is so large and therefore unable to individualize letters. When I asked to speak with XXXX supervisor, he stated that he did not have one, that  there were only people in the back on computers! \\n\\nOn XX/XX/19 I spoke with the representative from XXXX again. He is the only person this whole time who genuinely tried to assist me in resolving the problem. Within five minutes he spoke with his accounting department who told him that my {$280.00} check had been cashed by XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX stated that they would reimburse this amount to our checking account and note it as a missing check. \\n\\nWhen I called HD Credit Services again on XX/XX/19 and spoke with XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and finally XXXX, I was informed that my latest investigation was closed and I needed to take my dispute to my bank or XXXX  XXXX XXXX. At this point I was so frustrated with the process and lack of response from HD Credit Services that I decided to pay off the {$280.00} and asked that the interest and two months late fees be waived. XXXX said that it was their policy to only waive the current months late fee and the amount I owed was now {$310.00}. \\n\\nHowever, I received a letter dated XX/XX/19 which stated that under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, HD Credit Services was obliged to report my missed payment to XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX. While I understand there are federal regulations that must be followed, it seems extremely unfair that my credit rating, which has always been excellent, has been effected by a matter that was beyond my control. I paid my bill in a timely manner and followed through with everything that was asked of me by HD Credit Services.\"\\nI have a loan with CAPITAL ONE BANK USA. I have always made my payments on time. For some reason I realized that there was a late payment on my credit report. As you can see, I have always had a stellar payment record with this company.

There was definitely an error on their part.\\nI was shocked when I reviewed my credit report and found 30 days late payment on the dates XXXX 2013.

My only thought is that my monthly statement did not get to me.\\nOn the morning of XX/XX/XXXX I received a text notification from Bank of America asking me to verify three separate transactions for {$50.00} from XXXX network. After replying with a no I called and open a dispute with the fraud department as they still allowed the three {$50.00} charges to go through, even though I replied no as soon as the texts came in. After about a month on XX/XX/XXXX I get a letter from Bank of America saying they are denying my claim because XXXX says they delivered goods to me. I never received any goods and disputed this again which they said could take up to 45 days. Today on XX/XX/XXXX I get a letter in the mail saying they confirmed the information they had with XXXX and denied my claim again. I dont understand how they allow these charges to go through that triggered a text and I replied saying no dont let them go through immediately. I should not be liable for this as I was not grossly negligent in any way and I am not associated to these charges as XXXX states the charges were made overseas.\\n\"In XX/XX/2019, I applied for an American Express XXXX XXXX card and 1 hours later called Amex to cancel the opening of the card.

When I logged in, I was unable to access my Citi XXXX card and saw a message that said it was inactive. I was concerned because I had not deactivated or done any action to close the account. I was worried there was fraudulent behavior and called Citi at XXXX in the evening. I spoke to several reps, who advised that my account was shutdown by Citi because it was inactive for 15 or 18 months ( XXXXwo reps told me two different answers ). I was quite upset. This is my longest tenured credit account and it\\'s important for my credit score. It was extremely unfair of Citi, and honestly pretty deceptive, to shut the account down without telling me. On top of that, when i asked them to re-open the account they said it would take XXXX business days AND require a hard credit inquiry, notwithstanding the fact that I have an XXXX XXXX and another open credit card with active usage with them. \\n\\nIt was like Citi was intentional about damaging my credit and did so in a way that was unprofessional and hidden, they never reached out to inform me of their actions. I never received a notification my account would be closed. I had not read my credit terms in YEARS ( because I\\'d had the card for so long ) that my account would be shut down for inactivity, and they did not provide me any warnings or letters that it would get shut down. \\n\\nI pushed to escalate and was finally advised that a more senior customer rep would call me back shortly. I asked that they call me between XXXX and XXXX AM because I would most likely be unable to take a call later in the day.

I then received an email saying I could only request vouchers from the airlines and couldn\\'t get a refund. I did that and got two vouchers.

I called XXXX and they said I can\\'t get a cash refund because I have already accepted a voucher.

They said there is nothing they can do and did not admit to their error, although i told them to review my recorded customer service calls to listen in on how I was given no choice. XXXX is not an airline I plan to use in the future and they recently cancelled the itinerary I needed for the dates I needed, so I had to book a new flight at my expenses. The mis-communication was between Chase and XXXX and I dont think it\\'s fair for me to be stuck with a voucher I have no way to use. The total amount of the trip was {$560.00}, the amount that was not reimbursed was {$250.00} for a total of XXXX points ( I can\\'t see how many points for each flight, but I was already reimbersed points back for the XXXX airline leg ).\\n\"On XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed two suspicious charges to my Barclaycard CashForward Mastercard, both with a transaction date of XX/XX/XXXX, so I contacted Barclays ( XXXX ) to dispute the charges and to notify them of unauthorized activity on my account. The unauthorized charges were for two cash advances in the amount of {$200.00} each taken out and charged toward a XXXX XXXX XXXX. There were also two {$10.00} cash advance fees associated with the unauthorized transactions that I was disputing ... a total of {$420.00} worth of unauthorized transactions. \\n\\nThe representative took my information, issued a new replacement credit card number, opened a case with Barclays fraud department ( Case ID : XXXX ) and placed a provisional credit back on my account. When I next checked my online account information, there was only a provisional credit of {$210.00} ( half of the total unauthorized transactions ) so I called back on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX before finally getting a representative to place a provisional credit for the remaining unauthorized {$210.00} on my account ( Case ID : XXXX ). \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from XXXX ( XXXX ) stating that on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX ( a company that I have purchased from in the past ) became aware of a potential data security incident and partnered with XXXX to do independent computer forensics as part of an internal investigation. On XX/XX/XXXX, the investigation determined that payment card information was obtained without authorization on XX/XX/XXXX, and on XX/XX/XXXX, the investigation determined that my payment card information including my name, address, payment card number, expiration date, and payment card security code may have been obtained. This information, coinciding with the unauthorized transactions on my Barclaycard Mastercard account on XX/XX/XXXX, leads me to believe that my card information was indeed obtained in the XXXX XXXX data breach and then used to take out the cash advances for XXXX XXXX XXXX. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Barclays stating that their fraud investigation was complete and they found the disputed activity to be valid, thus they were reversing the provisional credit ( s ) and placing the amount owed back on the account. They have also now attached an additional {$5.00} interest charge on the cash advances to my account. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I called the XXXX number on the letter and spoke with a representative in Barclays fraud department who stated that their investigation showed that my card, which was never out of my possession, had to have been present at the time of the cash advances taken out with XXXX XXXX XXXX. The representative told me that my only recourse was to contact XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX and dispute the charge with XXXX XXXX. When I called the XXXX XXXX  number the representative stated that I would have to contact the fraud department but there was no telephone number for that department and I would need to send an email to XXXX. \\n\\nMy efforts to get these {$420.00} worth of unauthorized charges removed from my account have been fruitless thus far dealing with Barclays. On their website they claim, \"\" Use your card with confidence ... Count on Barclays \\' {$0.00} Fraud Liability protection.

A branch member informed me that because some of the charges were still pending, that I would have to return to the branch and submit a separate claim for the pending charges. While in the branch, the branch member and I were on the phone with Chase fraud department and was informed by the person on the phone that they were able to reverse all but one charge ( XX/XX/21 - XXXX XXXX XXXX {$84.00} ). I agreed to return the next day to submit another claim for the one charge. \\nXX/XX/21 - Returned to my local Chase branch ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, NY XXXX ) to have the claim for XXXX XXXX XXXX {$84.00} reversed. Branch member that I spoke to said everything was successful and I would be issued full credit for all 21 fraudulent charges. The refunds appeared on my account within XXXX hours. \\nXX/XX/21 - Went to check bank statements and saw that all fraudulent charges that I had been originally refunded by Chase were now reversed and Chase had reapplied all the fraudulent charges to my account. \\nXX/XX/21 - Called Chase fraud department and spoke to a specialist named XXXX, to inquire why the refunds were reversed by the bank. After some looking into my account, she informed me that while my branch had claimed that I would only have to submit one claim for all charges but one, that my branch had submitted duplicate claims for the same charges, and that the refunds for the fraudulent charges were now deemed invalid by the Chase fraud department. After asking why I was told differently by my local branch member, the fraud specialist on the phone informed me that an investigation would have to be submitted and looked into, and that I would have a final decision by the Chase fraud department in one business day. \\nXX/XX/21 - Received XXXX separate letters from the Chase customer claims department informing me that the fraudulent charges were authorized, and that they had actually missed one reversal, and would proceed to remove {$5.00} ( XX/XX/21 XXXX XXXX ) from my account, even though the reversal for that charge was included in one of my letters for reason of reversal. They informed me that they would not be taking any further actions to help my fraud case, and that all original fraud charges were valid charges and they would not be reversing them again. \\nXX/XX/21 - I went into another local Chase branch ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, NY XXXX ) again, to inquire why the decision was made to reverse my refunded charges. We once again got on the phone with the Chase fraud department, and they informed the branch member that because the charges were made using the chip on the debit card, that it was Chase policy to not refund charges made using a chip. I proceeded to explain that I wasnt told that in the beginning, and that no branch member or fraud specialist that I had spoke to had mentioned that to me. Also, that because my physical card had been stolen, anyone would have been able to insert into a chip reader and bypass using a PIN by selecting a credit option to be ran by the card reader. Not to mention that most chip reader machines do not require debit card PINs.\"\\nI was shocked when I reviewed my credit report and found 120 days late payment on the dates XX/XX/2019, XX/XX/2019. I am not sure how this happened, I believe that I had made my payments to you when I received my statements. My only thought is that my monthly statement did not get to me.\\nI have had two credit cards with Capitol One with large credit limits for more than 14 years and have never missed a payment. I added Authorized users to my account, they requested I provide them with copies of the persons drivers license and Social Security cards via a secure link they provided. The other day I had finally got the last copy of the Social Security card and uploaded to the link they provided. A day or so later, I tried to purchase electronics for my business and it was denied. I called Capitol One and was told they had closed out both my credit cards and my reward points were forfeited. I called them again today and was told there is nothing they can do to reinstate the cards or refund my reward points. The reason they are giving me for closing the accounts is that they can\\'t verify the documents I provided. I provided copies of front and back of the drivers licenses and Social Security cards as they requested. Is there anything I can do to get these cards reinstated, refund of my rewards points, and have them correct my credit report?\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I went to XXXX XXXX  XXXX ( Address : XXXX. XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, Phone : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) to fill up the car with gas ( XXXX sedan ) that we rented before returning it to XXXX. I gave my Bank of America Alaska Visa credit card to the attendant and he ran the card through his machine. He then told me it did not go through and he needed another card. I gave him a second Bank of America XXXX to try. He ran the card through his machine and then told me it did not go through either. My fiance then gave the attendant his Bank of America credit card. The attendant said this charge went through. The attendant did not provide us with any receipts. When I looked at my credit card transactions on both cards, I saw that the charge from XXXX to my Bank of America Alaska credit card in the amount of {$100.00} and the charge from XXXX to my Bank of America Mastercard in the amount of {$84.00} both posted. The charge to my fiance \\'s credit card in the amount of {$60.00} also posted to his credit card. When I attempted to contact XXXX, I got a message saying the party was temporarily unavailable. I filed disputes on both transactions on XX/XX/XXXX through Bank of America and provided supporting documentation. On XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, I received letters from Bank of America stating that they were unable to determine that a billing error occurred and they issued credits to my account for the disputed charges. The letters also stated that Bank of America was considering the dispute resolved but the merchant would have the opportunity to present new information on why the charges were valid. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received another letter from Bank of America notifying me that they reviewed the details of my dispute on my Alaska Visa credit card and were unable to pursue the dispute further. My Bank of America Alaska Credit Card was then charged the original disputed amount of {$100.00}. I called Bank of America to ask why my account was charged and was told that XXXX provided signed receipts for the transactions and because it was a chipped transaction, they had to consider it valid, and I was required to pay it. I did not sign any receipts when I was at XXXX because the attendant told me his machine was not working. I requested an appeal of Bank of America \\'s decision but was told because the signed receipts were provided by XXXX, there was nothing I could do, even though I did not sign anything and the receipts must have been forged. On XX/XX/XXXX, my Bank of America Mastercard was charged the original disputed amount of {$84.00} without any explanation from Bank of America.\\n\"We are USAA customer and have all of our financial life with USAA.

I also thought it was odd to get a paper statement. \\n\\nWhen I went to log online to my account, I could not access anything and was further alarmed it may have been hacked.

XX/XX/2020 launch a Charge Dispute through Discover Credit Card. Discover Card then issued a Temporary Credit/Refund back to my Discover card pending investigation. \\n5. XX/XX/2020 My neighbor delivers my XXXX item that had been wrongly delivered to his house. I immediately wrote a note to Discover informing Discover that I had received the product and was ok to pay XXXX. \\n6. First Week of XX/XX/2020 I returned the product to XXXX as I was not satisfied with it. \\n7. XX/XX/2020 XXXX acknowledges receipt of returned item. According to XXXX website, refund will be processed within 2 to 3 business days of receipt of item. \\n8. Over the past weeks I have reached out to Discover and XXXX multiple times to inform that I have still not been credited with the {$530.00} following return. Both parties have been unhelpful, and this continues to be a frustrating issue. \\n9. XX/XX/2020 reached out to Discover to follow up on issue once again Asked to speak to a Supervisor in the Disputes Resolution Dept. Supervisor could clearly see that refund had not been issued but was, again, very unhelpful, noting that it was possible that XXXX may have sent me a refund via check ( As a standard policy, I believe XXXX issues refunds back to the card or original means by which item was originally paid for ). Item was purchased with a Discover Credit Card so how is it possible that XXXX then decides to send me a refund via physical check OR Cash? \\n10. XXXX XXXX I again reached out to XXXX Customer Service via online Chat - XXXX noted that refund was sent to Discover Card on XX/XX/2020. They note that they did not recharge my Discover card when my neighbor delivered the product. Explanation does not make sense as returned item was received by XXXX on XX/XX/2020. \\nI am now caught in a bureaucratic web between XXXX and Discover Credit Card. I have provided evidence to Discover that indicates that XXXX has received returned item. Discover Dispute Supervisor is now saying that it is possible that XXXX may have sent me a physical check for the returned item and wants me to prove that is not the case. How do I prove that? Send all my various bank account statements to Discover to evidence that I have not received the {$530.00} from XXXX? \\nDiscover Credit Card - why not simply reach out to XXXX to verify whether a refund was sent to me? In this intervening time, Discover Card continues to charge interest rate on my account for a product that is no longer in my possession. \\nXXXX - Can you directly contact Discover to resolve this matter and issue this refund? \\nI look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible to resolve this matter. I am enclosing copies of various supporting documents listed below. I may be contacted at the above address and phone number. \\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX CC : XXXX, XXXX CC : https : XXXX CC : ftc.gov/complaint ATTATCHMENTS : 1. XXXX Order Receipt 2. Charge Dispute email to XXXX 3.  Letter to Discover Card follow delivery of item by neighbor 4. XXXX XXXX Return Acknowledgement notification 5. XXXX XXXX chat script XX/XX/2020 6.
